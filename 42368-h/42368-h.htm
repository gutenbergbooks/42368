<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<p>The greater part of this short narrative was written years ago.
At that time it was intended for publication. But for several years
past the writer had declined ever letting it come before the world;
and had it not been for the solicitations of friends, it is highly
probable this intention would never have been changed. But relying
upon the opinion of those whom he believed to be well qualified to
judge of it, and believing them to be sincere in their expression
of opinion, I have consented to let it go and take its chance
before the public.</p>
<p>It was found difficult to give such an account of that part of
the campaign which it was thought to be most important, without
commencing as far back as the departure of the army from Kentucky.
This part of the history has, however, been passed over very
rapidly, perhaps rather too much so to make it at all satisfactory.
The writer is aware that he has omitted much which would have added
to the interest of this little history; but he has not leisure to
go over it again. History has given us an account of the sufferings
of the North-Western Army only in general terms, but no where, so
far as I have been able to learn, has there been given a particular
detail of the sufferings and privations of that detachment of the
army.</p>
<p>I think it proper that the rising generation should know what
their fathers suffered, and how they acted in the hour of danger;
that they sustained the double character of "<i>Americans and
Kentuckians</i>." This narrative has been made as concise as I could
conveniently make it, and on that account, perhaps, the writer has
not said all that might, and that should have been said. But it is
hoped that what has been said will be sufficient to give the
youthful reader some idea of what that "Spartan band" were called
to endure. To the old men of our country these things, perhaps,
will not be new.</p>
<p>With regard to the massacre at Raisin, the writer has related
nothing but what he saw. What is said in reference to the brave
Hart and Hickman, he witnessed with his own eyes.</p>
<p>It may be thought that I have been a little too severe in what I
have said of British officers. Should any think so, all I have to
say is, had they seen and felt what we did there would have been no
difference of opinion. By some it will be thought strange to find
the savages, in point of feeling and humanity, placed above the
British&mdash;but the truth ought always to be told.</p>
<p>One thing the writer regrets, and that is his being compelled so
frequently to speak of himself. But he found it impossible to give
a full narration without it. Nothing is aimed at but a plain
unvarnished statement of facts, a sober description of scenes, in
the principal part of which the writer himself was an actor.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>NARRATIVE.</h3>
<p>The volunteers from Kentucky, under the command of Colonels
Allen, Lewis and Scott, left their homes on the 12th of August,
1812, and rendezvoused at Georgetown. Thence took the Dry Ridge
road to Cincinnati, where we remained a few days. We then pursued
our march through the State of Ohio, by the way of Piqua; from
which place we were called to the relief of Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>Nothing worthy of public notice occurred on the way, except the
alarm we had at the camp we called "Fighton," which every soldier
that was on the ground no doubt recollects. Though we were alarmed
at Piqua, by one of the sentinels shooting at a horse, yet we had
seen nothing such as occurred here. It was a dark rainy night, just
such a time as the Indians would choose to make an attack. We
anticipated danger, and made arrangements to meet it. The army
encamped in a hollow square, within a strong breastwork, and guards
were placed at every point. Whether there were Indians about or
not, some of the guard thought they heard them, and many guns were
fired on post, and all the camp called to arms. The line of battle
was more than once formed during the night, and at one time kept
under arms an hour and a half. As this was the the first campaign
with most of us, and also the first alarm worthy of notice, it is
not easy to imagine the degree of excitement produced throughout
the camp. It fell to my lot to be on guard that night, and at the
time of the greatest alarm was on post; the guard was not relieved
for near an hour after their time had expired&mdash;an attack being
momently expected.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Fort Wayne, we found that the Indians which
had annoyed the fort for some time, had retreated. We were then
ordered to march to two Indian towns, for the purpose of burning
the houses and destroying their corn. When we had accomplished
this, and returned to Fort Wayne, we there met the Kentucky mounted
volunteers under the command of Colonel Simrall. We marched from
Fort Wayne on the 22d of September, and pursued Wayne's route down
the Miami towards old Fort Defiance, where we arrived on the 30th.
During the latter part of this march we were frequently annoyed by
the enemy. Our advance party of spies fell in with a body of
Indians, and a small skirmish ensued, in which one of the spies was
slightly wounded, and several of the enemy killed; the exact number
could not be ascertained, as the Indians always carry off their
dead when practicable. The day before, Ensign Liggett, of the
regulars, with four men, was pursued by this body of Indians,
massacred and scalped. The loss of Ensign Liggett was much
lamented, as he was a promising young officer, remarkable for
bravery and intrepidity. He had left the company of spies, with his
four companions, to examine the country around Fort Defiance, and
had advanced several miles ahead of the party&mdash;where they were
killed. Many of Ensign Liggett's friends are still living in
Kentucky.</p>
<p>The annoyance from the enemy greatly retarded our movements, as
it was impossible, with any degree of certainty, to ascertain
either their situation or force. In crossing the river, however,
their whole movements were discovered. The British, with their
artillery from Detroit, and a large party of Indians, were
progressing towards Fort Wayne. After engaging our spies, and
annoying our advanced guard, they faced to the right about and
retreated precipitately. Owing to the situation of the army (being
short of provisions) it was impossible, by forced marches, to
intercept them. At this time Captain Bland Ballard showed his skill
in Indian fighting, by making good his retreat, for which he
deserves much. His Lieutenant, Munday, who had parted with him in
the morning, also effected a retreat, by charging upon the Indians,
before they ascertained his numbers, and then dashing into camp.
The next day our spies had an action&mdash;had one wounded&mdash;and saw
several Indians fall. The day following the Indians showed in front
of the spies, and snapped at one of our men&mdash;a fire was returned,
which left blood where the Indians stood. The Indian spies were on
horse back, which rendered it difficult to ascertain their
situation. Our spies could not, with propriety, venture far from
us, and we could not advance until the country was reconnoitered,
consequently our march was slow. A short turn to the right,
however, and crossing the river at an unexpected place, gave us the
advantage. After crossing the river we saw that the enemy had
artillery, and were ahead of us. We were now within six miles of
Defiance. It was very bushy for more than a mile before we
approached the fort. The army remained at camp that morning, and
sent out spies in every direction; when they returned, they
reported that the enemy had gone off down the river. It was then
deemed inexpedient to move so late in the afternoon. It was
supposed there were from one to two hundred British, with from two
to five pieces of cannon, and from four to six hundred Indians. The
artillery was certainly brought up by water to this place, and
reembarked here again. Their object must have been Fort Wayne. By
this time we became very scarce of provisions, having nothing for
some days but the poorest beef. Some of the men began to
murmer&mdash;and some went so far as to talk of returning home&mdash;but when
this was known by the officers, measures were taken to put a stop
to it. Colonel Allen, in an animated and encouraging address to his
men, banished the idea of shrinking in the day of adversity.
Captain Simpson, also, was not unemployed. This was the first time
we had sensibly felt the want of bread.</p>
<p>General Harrison returned to the army on the second of October.
We were greatly animated at seeing him among us once more. He
addressed the whole army in a most thrilling speech, which kindled
in the breasts of the men, generally, an increased desire to meet
the enemy, and a willingness to endure any privations they might be
called to suffer. He remained with us but a short time.</p>
<p>The enemy having retreated before us in every direction, leaving
us an extensive territory to occupy; our object then was to
establish a chain of fortified posts, in order to facilitate the
supplies necessary for a speedy invasion of Upper Canada.
Notwithstanding we were in the enemy's country, where Indian spies
were seen almost every day, yet it was impossible to keep the men
from imprudently hazarding their lives! Shortly after our arrival
at Fort Defiance, five of our men, who had been out gathering
plums, were found scalped. About this time Captain Garrard's troop
of horse, and another company, met a scouting party of Indians and
routed them. One of our militia was killed and another wounded. In
consequence of this information, General Harrison marched the whole
of his army from St. Mary's to Defiance. General Harrison had heard
from General Kelso, who commanded a detachment of troops on lake
Erie, that <i>two thousand</i> Indians and some regulars with several
pieces of artillery, had left Malden on an expedition against Fort
Wayne! This news, with other exaggerated accounts, induced the
belief that General Winchester was likely to be defeated. As before
stated, all the forces at St. Mary's were put in motion, but before
they reached Defiance information of the enemy's retreat was
received.</p>
<p>Before General Harrison left Defiance, he selected a situation
for a new fort. A party of men was detailed to procure timber for
the buildings. General Winchester, also, moved his camp from the
Miami to the Auglaize river.</p>
<p>The command of the left was now confided to General Winchester,
who was instructed to occupy the rapids as soon as possible for the
purpose of securing a quantity of corn which had been raised by the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Before General Harrison left, he ordered General Tupper to take
all his mounted men and proceed down the Miami as far as the
Rapids. When this order was issued, General Tupper's command was
immediately supplied with provision for eight days, which included
all the flour in camp. About 12 o'clock next day a party of Indians
fired on the men immediately on the opposite bank of the Miami, one
of whom they killed, scalped, and then fled! This, for a moment,
produced alarm, and the troops were formed in order of battle.
Presently small parties of horsemen began to cross the river in
pursuit of the enemy. The horses were mostly at grass, and as soon
as they could be caught the owners engaged in the pursuit. Eight or
ten parties went, mostly from Colonel Simrall's regiment, in one of
which was the Colonel himself. General Tupper ordered that no more
should cross, apprehending from the boldness of the Indians that a
large body might be lying in ambush. General Winchester now ordered
Tupper to commence his expedition towards the Rapids by pursuing
these Indians. Tupper had previously sent Logan and six other
Indians to reconnoiter, and did not seem willing to go until they
returned. They arrived in the evening, stating that they had seen a
party of Indians, about fifty strong, ten miles down the river.
Colonel Allen now offered his services to accompany Tupper to the
Rapids in any station he thought proper to place him, from a
private soldier upwards. He accepted his offer, and caused him to
be announced as his aid. General Winchester issued positive orders
that General Tupper should proceed; but he declined, saying he
would prefer going by the Ottoway towns, &amp;c. At this time about
three hundred of the mounted riflemen, whose terms of service had
expired, left the camp and returned home. Colonel Simrall,
believing that the orders of General Winchester to General Tupper
would not be executed, returned to the settlements to recruit his
horses and be in readiness to march when his services should be
necessary. It will be sufficient to say this expedition at this
time failed. After the mounted men left us, nothing of importance
occurred for some time. We were engaged building the fort, which,
through much difficulty, was at length completed. This will appear,
when it is known that at that place we had not our full rations.
That this fact may be established, I will give some extracts from a
letter, written at the time, by James Garrard, Brigade Inspector:
"We have not" says he "drawn a full ration since the 8th September.
Sometimes without beef&mdash;at other times without flour: and the worst
of all, entirely without salt, which has been much against the
health of the men. They bear it with much patience, although they
have been without salt for five or six days." At this time the sick
amounted to two hundred and sixteen men, and there was some
dissatisfaction in the army against the government because the
necessary supplies were not sent on. But when they became
acquainted with the true cause of the deficiency, that the fault
was not in the government, but in the change of affairs since their
march, they were perfectly satisfied. Again Mr. Garrard states:
"You would be surprised to see the men appear on the brigade
parade. Some without shoes, others without socks, blankets, &amp;c.
All the clothes they have are linen; but they discharge their duty
with cheerfulness, hoping that their country will supply their
wants before the severity of winter comes on." There are many who
can testify to the truth of the above. What clothes we took with us
when we left our homes had worn very thin. Many left home with
their linen hunting shirts, and some of these were literally torn
to rags by the brush. We had heard that General Harrison had made a
powerful appeal to the ladies of Kentucky and Ohio, and we were
sure it would not be in vain; and about this time we learned that
the ladies of Kentucky were exerting themselves to relieve the
soldiers of this army. It was highly gratifying to us to know that
we were kept in remembrance by the ladies of our own State.</p>
<p>Near this time our spies brought in a prisoner. They took him
about thirty miles below Fort Winchester. He called himself William
Walker; had been with the Indians near thirty years, and was
married to a Wyandott squaw; he said at that time he lived at
Detroit. He was recognized by several in camp, and two men said,
"when Detroit was taken, under General Hull, he was painted like an
Indian, and was seen out of the fort," but they did not recollect
any act of hostility on his part. His story was, that he persuaded
the Indians to abandon the British; that in the end we would ruin
them, &amp;c. That for this he was put into the guard-house at
Detroit, and told his conduct was criminal, and consequently would
be sent where he would be kept safely; that he made his escape from
the guard-house&mdash;lay concealed a few days until he was ready&mdash;and
then started to join us. The general belief was he came as a spy.
He seemed intimately acquainted with the Indian movements, but the
officers were afraid to place any reliance upon his statements. He
gave us a description of the force we met near Defiance on their
way to Fort Wayne. He estimated their number at about nine hundred
Indians and British altogether, with two brass field pieces; that
the afternoon on which we crossed the Miami, they were at Fort
Defiance, which was only six miles from where we crossed the river,
and that they started early next morning towards the Rapids. From
him we learned that McCoy of Georgetown, whom we supposed was
murdered, had been taken prisoner. Upon being asked if any
prisoners had been taken, he replied one&mdash;a Quarter Master
Sergeant. McCoy filled that place.</p>
<p>We now began preparations to march towards the Rapids&mdash;having
completed a new and beautiful fort, situated near the old one,
which, like its brave progenitor, had fallen before the
irresistible hand of time. We crossed the Miami, and camped a few
miles below Defiance. During the time of our encampment we were
called to witness a very solemn transaction. A young man was found
sleeping on post&mdash;he was arraigned and sentenced to be shot. When
the time appointed for his execution arrived, the army was
paraded&mdash;the prisoner was brought to the spot&mdash;a bandage placed
over his eyes&mdash;and directed to prepare to meet death. A platoon was
ordered to take their stand a few paces in front of the lines,
ready to fire when the word should be given. A deep silence now
reigned throughout the army&mdash;every eye was fixed upon the criminal,
standing upon his knees blindfolded&mdash;the officer commanding the
platoon waiting to hear and give the word which would hurry a
fellow soldier into eternity. During this moment of suspense a
messenger came from the General bearing a reprieve. This
circumstance made a deep impression upon the whole army. It was
found necessary, also, to make an example of one who had deserted.
His sentence was to ride the wooden horse; which was made by
bending a sapling until the top reached the ground&mdash;this he did in
the presence of the whole army.</p>
<p>Very few Indians were seen or heard of for some weeks, neither
had any mischief been done, though the men were very careless, and
would hunt game and fruit far and near&mdash;often strolling miles from
the camp without guns. The ground on this side of the river, where
we first encamped, being disagreeable, we marched a few miles down
the river, remained a short time, and then removed to what is
called camp No. 3. There we had a beautiful situation, and an
abundance of fine timber.</p>
<p>Although the enemy had now retreated and left us in possession
of the Territory, we were still called to contend with the severe
weather, which not only prevented the necessary supply of
provisions from reaching us, but in our thinly clad condition
became very oppressive. We knew that efforts were making to supply
us with clothes and rations, but the roads were almost impassable.
About the first of November the men became very sickly&mdash;the typhus
fever raged with violence&mdash;three or four would sometimes die in a
day. It is said upwards of three hundred was on the sick list at
one time.</p>
<p>Towards the latter part of November, or first of December, the
rain fell in torrents. We were ordered to build huts, for to
advance at that time appeared impossible. Many were so entirely
destitute of shoes and other clothing, that had they been compelled
to march any distance they must have frozen. What we suffered at
Defiance was but the beginning of affliction. We now saw nothing
but hunger, and cold, and nakedness, staring us in the face. At one
time, for several days, we scarcely had any thing to eat but some
poor beef. I have seen the butchers go to a beef and kill it, when
lying down and could not get out of the way. This kind of beef, and
hickory roots, was our principal subsistence for a length of time.
When we had been here a few weeks, and the ground became covered
with snow, and we no longer apprehended danger from the enemy, we
were permitted to hunt. This we did to some extent, but in a short
time there was not a squirrel to be found near the encampment.</p>
<p>During our stay at camp No. 3, a detachment was sent down the
river to assist General Tupper. I was one of the number called out
for that expedition; and a hard and fruitless one it was. Colonel
Lewis commanded. We marched until about nine o'clock at night.
Colonel C. S. Todd, with some others, was sent on to Tupper's
encampment to make some discoveries, and when the arrived at the
spot they found that Tupper had retreated, and one of his men left
dead in the camp! This information was brought to Colonel Lewis,
and after a council with his officers, he considered it prudent to
return. He thought if it were necessary for Tupper, with six
hundred and fifty men, to retreat, and the river too between him
and the enemy, he could not be justified in meeting it on the same
side with three hundred and eighty. It was stated, but I would not
vouch for the truth of it, that he left the Rapids a few hours
after he sent the express to our camp, without notifying our
detachment at all.</p>
<p>Early next morning we commenced our retreat, but from the
fatigues of the previous day, and want of rest that night, (for we
had no fire,) the most of us were unable to reach the army that
day, but were obliged to camp about five miles below. This was a
night of keen suspense to myself, and no doubt many others. We had
grounds to believe the Indians would pursue us with perhaps double
our number, and surprise us in the night; but we reached the camp
in safety next morning.</p>
<p>Our Indian spies made frequent excursions in different
directions, but their reports were not generally satisfactory.
<i>Logan</i>, one of the finest looking Indians I ever saw, was one of
them, and perhaps the only honest man among them, finding that they
were suspected either of cowardice or treachery, determined on
another expedition to the Rapids. But before leaving, expressed his
grief at the stain cast upon his character&mdash;declaring at the same
time that something should be done before his return that should
convince all concerned of his bravery and friendship to the
Government of the United States. Old <i>Captain John</i>, and
<i>Lightfoot</i>, if I mistake not, accompanied him. They had not
reached the Rapids before they fell in with the spies of the
British&mdash;a company of Indians superior to their own, commanded by a
young British officer: they managed the affair with great
dexterity. Logan, who was a man of great presence of mind, finding,
upon first sight of the enemy, a retreat to be impracticable,
instantly proposed to his comrades to approach them in the
character of friends, and report themselves as deserters from camp
No. 3. Though they had but a very few moments, yet Logan fixed upon
the signal, and concerted the plan of escape. They met&mdash;Logan made
his statement, which was received cautiously, but so far as to
prevent immediate hostilities. They were permitted to keep their
arms, but ordered to march in front, a plain indication that they
were suspected.</p>
<p>As the object of this band of British spies was to gain
information in reference to the army at camp No. 3, they considered
their object accomplished, and therefore returned from this place.
A conversation soon commenced respecting the condition, number, and
intentions of the army, &amp;c., &amp;c., during which time Logan
and his two companions were watching their opportunity to make the
attack. Although they doubled their number, yet they determined to
<i>rescue themselves or die</i>. The signal was given, and each man
brought his man to the ground. This left their power about equal.
The enemy fled a little distance, and opened a fire upon them,
which they returned with the arms of those they had shot; but
finding a retreat now practicable, Logan ordered it, but in
mounting one of the horses of the enemy, received a ball in his
breast which ranged down to the small of his back; but,
notwithstanding, succeeded in reaching the camp that night, a
distance of about thirty miles. Old Captain John would not leave
the spot until he had taken a scalp, which he brought to camp with
him. Every effort was made by the physicians to save the life of
this brave and daring man, but all in vain. I saw him a few hours
before his death. He died like a soldier. But before his death, was
heard to say&mdash;"I suppose this will be taken as evidence of my
bravery, and I shall be no longer suspected as a traitor."</p>
<p>His death was greatly lamented, and his loss severely felt&mdash;and
the circumstances taken altogether, rendered the case exceedingly
affecting, especially to some of the officers.</p>
<p>One of the most extraordinary characters in all the army, was an
old man by the name of <i>Ruddle</i> who acted as a spy; this man made
many excursions alone, and would remain for several days together,
almost in the heart of the enemy; and perhaps advanced farther to
discover the movements of the British and Indians, than even our
Indian spies. During the stay at camp No. 3, the most of the
information that could be relied upon, respecting the supplies
which it was expected we should find in the fields at the Rapids,
came through <i>Ruddle</i>. Such dauntless courage is not often found.
To look at him you would think him touched off a little with the
<i>Potawatamie</i>. He was well acquainted with the Indian mode of
warfare; and, if I mistake not, had once been a prisoner among
them.</p>
<p>Soon after this the river was frozen so as to bear us across.
This enlarged our hunting ground, for now we were suffering greatly
for provisions. At one time, for eleven days, we had nothing but
pork, just killed, without salt. These privations were submitted to
with astonishing patience&mdash;there was scarcely a whisper or a murmur
in all the camp&mdash;which manifested a patriotism worthy the cause in
which they were engaged. On the 22d of December we were informed,
by general order, that we should have flour that day, and that the
prospect was fair for a constant supply.</p>
<p>The 24th was the period set for our stay at camp No. 3, which
was pleasing intelligence to the whole army. On the 25th, at
sunrise, we were commanded to march to the Rapids. Being the
vanguard of the North-Western Army, General Harrison instructed us
to make a stand there until we should be joined by the
North-Western Army. For some time previous we had been engaged in
making sleds to haul our baggage, some of which had to be drawn by
the soldiers themselves.</p>
<p>A more pleasant and expeditious march than this had been
anticipated, for after much fatigue and labor, a great number of
canoes had been made, with which we expected our baggage would be
taken with great ease and safety down the river; but to our great
disappointment, before we could make preparations, or before our
provisions reached us&mdash;without which we could not move&mdash;cold
weather set in, and closed up the river. This circumstance at first
seemed to present an obstacle insurmountable; many of the men were
sick, and that sickness occasioned by being compelled to eat fresh
pork without bread or salt, and from being exposed to cold and
wet.</p>
<p>But this was not the only difficulty. Many who had not been so
provident, perhaps, as the case required, were bare of clothes, and
almost barefooted, and were ill prepared to undertake such a march
through the snow.</p>
<p>Thus, ill clad, worn down by fatigue and starvation, and chilled
by the cold wintry blasts of the north we were compelled to
brave&mdash;there was no alternative&mdash;our condition made it necessary
for us to fall upon some other plan to reach the Rapids, where we
expected to meet supplies. Under the impulse of this hope we went
to work and made sleds sufficient to carry the baggage. But as
these were not sufficient to take the sick, many of them had to be
left behind. On the 25th, as above stated, we bid adieu to this
memorable place, camp No. 3, where lie the bones of many a brave
man. This place will live in the recollection of all who suffered
there, and for more reasons than one. There comes up before the
mind the many times the dead march was heard in the camp, and the
solemn processsion that carried our fellow sufferers to the
grave&mdash;the many times we were almost on the point of
starvation&mdash;and the many sickening disappointments which were
experienced by the army from day to day, and from week to week, by
the failure of promised supplies, which were daily expected: and,
also, that here we parted with the sick, some of whom we were to
see no more.</p>
<p>Thus poorly equipped, deeply affected, and yet overjoyed, we
took up the line of march. The reader may ask how such a number of
sleds could be drawn, seeing there was not a supply of horses. Some
of them were drawn by the <i>men themselves</i>&mdash;five men were hitched
to a sleigh, and, through snow and water, dragged them on at the
rate of about ten miles a day. But to our great disadvantage during
our march, there was an immense fall of snow. It seemed that the
very elements fought against us. But notwithstanding all, we moved
slowly on towards the destined point. What the men suffered by day,
was comparatively nothing to what they experienced by night. The
reader can form but a faint idea unless he had been on the spot,
and had seen and felt what we saw and felt. Some time was required
to arrange the encampment, during which time the men were compelled
to keep their places in the lines, and thus become so chilled as to
be almost unfit for the necessary exertion of preparing a resting
place for themselves. The snow, which was about knee deep, had
first to be cleared away, then fire to be struck with flint and
steel, and when no lynn bark could be had, brush was substituted in
its place, which formed our bed. Hard and uncomfortable as it was,
yet such was our fatigue that we generally slept soundly. To give a
detailed account of individual suffering during this march, from
camp No. 3 to the Rapids, would swell this sketch beyond its
intended limits; and perhaps facts would be related which the
present generation, who have but little knowledge of these things
only from report, would scarcely believe.</p>
<p>Our little vehicles being made upon a small scale, were too
light to carry the burden put upon them, and not sufficiently high
to cross the little streams which lay in our way, consequently much
damage was done to our baggage, and our provisions (which were
barely sufficient to last us to the Rapids,) was much injured by
getting wet. This, it will be plainly seen, was well calculated to
increase our sufferings. In fact, the half of what was endured on
this slow and painful march has never yet been published to the
world, and perhaps never will.</p>
<p>"While on our march, General Winchester received another
despatch from the commander-in-chief, recommending him to abandon
the movement towards the Rapids, and fall back with the greater
part of his force to Fort Jennings. This advice was given in
consequence of some intelligence received from Colonel Campbell, at
Massiniway, respecting the force of Tecumseh on the Wabash. General
Harrison was apprehensive if the left wing advanced so far as the
Rapids, Tecumseh would be able to attack and destroy all the
provisions in the rear." Winchester had already commenced his
march, and did not wish to discontinue and return.</p>
<p>At length, on the 10th of January, we arrived at the Rapids.
General Winchester had previously sent forward a detachment of six
hundred and seventy men, under General Payne, to attack a body of
Indians which General Harrison had been informed was lying in an
old fortification at Swan creek, a few miles farther down the
river. After passing several miles below the old fort, and
discovering no appearance of Indians, the whole returned to the
position which the army intended to occupy.</p>
<p>About this time the clothes which were sent by the patriotic
sons and daughters of Kentucky, began to reach the army. The
gratitude of the troops generally was beyond expression. Some had
withstood the keen blasts of that cold northern country, until some
time in January, with linen hunting shirts and pantaloons, and many
almost without either shoes or socks. General Payne in a letter to
Governor Shelby, in which he expresses his gratitude, as well as
that of the troops, says&mdash;"As an <i>earnest</i> of her disposition to
aid the National Government, Kentucky, at an early period, with a
characteristic ardour, sent forth more than her quota required by
the Government; and whilst a spark of genuine feeling animates the
breasts of her volunteers in the North-Western Army, they can never
cease to feel a lively gratitude for the further <i>earnest</i> of her
anxiety for the cause, manifested in the late abundant supply of
clothing." It certainly was a source of heartfelt satisfaction, to
express a proper sense of the obligations under which the
patriotism of the <i>sons</i> of Kentucky had placed her volunteers; but
the pleasure was greatly heightened when we reflected that to the
<i>daughters</i> of Kentucky we were mostly indebted for imperious
supplies to meet the blasts of a northern winter.</p>
<p>I hope it is not still too late (though many who engaged in that
laudable work have gone from this scene of war and bloodshed,) for
me to express my unfeigned gratitude to the daughters of my native
State for the blessings bestowed on me as an individual; and as I
have never had an opportunity before to express myself, permit me
further to say, that these favors, while I possess a spark of
feeling, shall never cease to produce a lively sense of gratitude.
Help, in real need, is not forgotten.</p>
<p>"On the day of our arrival a recent Indian camp was discovered
about one half mile from us. Captain Williams was immediately
despatched, with twenty five men, to pursue the Indians. He very
soon overtook and routed them. A few shots were exchanged, by which
some on both sides were wounded."</p>
<p>A large storehouse was immediately commenced for the purpose of
securing the provisions and baggage. We found a quantity of corn in
the fields, which was soon gathered; and before any machinery was
prepared to pound and sift it, a quantity was boiled whole, and
eaten without even salt. But we quickly arranged to have it made
into hommony, and after the hogs came, we fared well upon "hog and
hommony." You may judge of our relish for our food, when I tell you
that one of our company, whose name I will not give, eat so much
corn that he appeared to be actually foundered, and unable to walk
for more than a week.</p>
<p>On the evening of the thirteenth, two Frenchmen arrived from the
river <i>Raisin</i> with information that the Indians routed by Captain
Williams had passed that place on their way to Malden, carrying
with them intelligence of our advance. They said the Indians had
threatened to kill their inhabitants and burn their town, and
begged for protection from the American arms. They were charged
with a despatch from Mr. Day, a citizen who was friendly to our
cause, and who stated that the British were seizing all suspected
persons at the river "Raisin," and confining them at Malden prison,
and were preparing to carry off all provisions of every
description. On the <i>fourteenth</i> another messenger arrived, and on
the <i>sixteenth</i> two more came in. They all confirmed the news
brought by the first, and solicited protection, as they were afraid
the people would be massacred and the town burned by the Indians
whenever our army should advance upon them. They stated the present
force of the enemy to be two companies of Canadians, and about two
hundred Indians, but that more Indians might be expected to
assemble. The greatest anxiety now prevailed in our army to advance
in force sufficient to defeat the enemy at that place. A council of
officers was called by the General, a majority of whom were
decidedly in favor of sending a strong detachment&mdash;Colonel Allen
supported that side of the question with ardour.</p>
<p>On the morning of the seventeenth, Colonel Lewis, with five
hundred and fifty men, took up their line of march for the "river
Raisin." The same day Colonel Allen followed with one hundred and
ten more, who came up with Lewis late in the evening, where he was
encamped at Presque Isle, Early on the morning of the same day
General Winchester prepared a despatch to inform General Harrison
of this movement. He stated that his principal object was to
prevent the flour and grain from being carried off by the enemy;
that if he got possession of Frenchtown he intended to hold it, and
that a co-operating reinforcement from the right wing might be
necessary.</p>
<p>Before the express had started with this letter, information was
received from Colonel Lewis at Presque Isle, a distance of twenty
miles in advance, that there were four hundred Indians at the river
Raisin, and that Colonel Elliott was expected from Malden, with a
detachment to attack the camp at the Rapids. Colonel Lewis set out
very early next morning, intending, if possible, to anticipate
Colonel Elliott at Frenchtown. That village lies midway between
Presque Isle and Malden, the distance to each being eighteen miles.
The most of our march was on the ice on Miami bay, and the borders
of lake Erie. When we had arrived within a few miles of the river
Raisin we were discovered by some Indians, who hastened to give the
alarm to the main body of the enemy. Before we left the border of
the lake, a halt was called to take some refreshment. Having
resumed our march, a piece of timbered land was passed through, and
as the troops proceeded in the open plain they were formed into
three lines, each corps being in the proper place for action. The
right was commanded by Colonel Allen, and was composed of the
companies of Captains McCracken, Bledsoe, and Matson. I was in
Captain Bledsoe's company during this expedition. The left wing was
commanded by Major Graves, and was composed of the companies of
Hamilton, Williams, and Kelly. The centre consisted of the
companies of Hightower, Collier, and Sabree, and was commanded by
Major Madison. The advance guard consisted of the companies of
Captains Hickman, Graves, and Jones, under the command of Captain
Ballard, acting as Major.</p>
<p>When we arrived within a quarter of a mile of the village, and
discovered the enemy in motion, the line of battle was formed&mdash;
expecting an immediate attack&mdash;but it was soon perceived the enemy
did not intend to risk a combat in the open field. The detachment
broke off by the right of companies and marched under the fire of
the enemy's cannon until we arrived on the river. We succeeded well
in crossing, though the ice in many places was very slippery.
Having crossed, instantly the long roll was beat (the signal for a
general charge.) Majors Graves and Madison were ordered to possess
themselves of the houses and picketing, about which the enemy had
collected, and where they had placed their cannon. This order was
promptly executed, and both battalions advanced under an incessant
shower of bullets; neither the picketing nor fencing over which
they passed retarded their progress or success, for the enemy in
that quarter was dislodged.&mdash;meantime, Colonel Allen fell in with
them a considerable distance to the right, when, after pursuing
them to the woods, they made a stand with their howitzer and small
arms, covered by a chain of inclosed lots and a group of houses,
having in their rear a thick brushy wood filled with fallen timber.
Orders were now given through Major Garrard to Majors Graves and
Madison to possess themselves of the woods on the left, and move up
towards the main body of the enemy as fast as practicable, and
divert their attention from Colonel Allen. At the moment the fire
commenced with the battalions, the right wing advanced, and the
enemy was soon driven from the fencing and houses, and our troops
began to enter the woods in close pursuit. The fight now became
very close, and extremely hot on the right wing&mdash;the enemy
concentrating the chief of their forces of both kinds to force the
lines, but still kept moving in a retreat, although slowly, for we
were much exhausted. The joint exertions of Graves, Madison, and
Allen, were successful in completely routing the enemy. The
distance they retreated before us was not less than <i>two</i> miles,
and every foot of the way under charge. The battle lasted from
three o'clock until dark! The detachment was then drawn off in good
order, and encamped upon the ground the enemy first occupied. About
the going down of the sun, I received a wound in my right shoulder.
A moment before I received the shot, I saw John Locke and Joseph
Simpson advancing together, some distance to the left, and ahead of
the main body. One was killed and the other wounded not far from
the spot where I last saw them.</p>
<p>"The gallant conduct," says Colonel Lewis, "of Colonel Allen
during every charge of this warmly contested action, has raised for
him no ordinary military merit. Majors Graves and Madison deserve
high praise for their undeviating attention to orders, and the
energy and despatch with which they executed them. Captain Blan B.
Ballard also led the van with great skill and bravery." He further
says: "I take this opportunity of tendering my most hearty thanks
to Brigade Major Garrard, Captain Smith, and Adjutant McCuller, who
acted as my aids, for the great support they gave me during the
whole of the action. The company officers acted with great
bravery." The Colonel closes by saying, "both officers and soldiers
supported the double character of Americans and Kentuckians." It
was impossible for us to ascertain the exact force of the enemy;
but from the best information, there were about <i>one</i> hundred
British and <i>four</i> hundred Indians. It was said Major Reynolds was
present and commanded the whole. Their number killed we could not
ascertain, and perhaps it is unknown to the Americans until the
present time. From the number found on the field where the battle
commenced, and from the blood and trails where they had dragged off
their dead and wounded, the slaughter must have been considerable.
One Indian and two Canadian militia were taken prisoners. So steady
and composed were our men in the assaults, that while the enemy
were killed or driven from their houses, not a woman or child was
injured. Our loss was <i>twelve</i> killed and fifty five wounded.
Joseph Simpson was the only man belonging to Captain Simpson's
company that was killed in the first engagement. Very few of our
men were killed or wounded until we reached the woods; here we
fought under great disadvantages, not being acquainted with the
ground, and most of us being unacquainted with the Indian mode of
warfare. Thus our want of experience and eagerness to overtake the
enemy, gave them a decided advantage over us. Their method was to
retreat rapidly until they were out of sight, (which was soon the
case in the brushy woods,) and while we were advancing they were
preparing to give us another fire; so we were generally under the
necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating. During the
charge, I saw several of our brave boys lying upon the snow
wallowing in the agonies of death. But none could stop even to help
his brother, for our situation required the utmost exertion of
every man as long as he could render any service.</p>
<p>It was sometime after dark before we reached the place from
which we drove the enemy, where we encamped for the night, and
where we were accommodated with all the necessaries of life, and
every attention which our situation required. I cannot but speak a
word in favor of our physicians: too much cannot be said in their
praise for the prompt attention which they gave on that occasion.
Though it was late before the houses were prepared, and other
arrangements made for the accommodation of the wounded, yet every
man had his wounds dressed before the surgeons took any rest. Their
memory deserves to be perpetuated.</p>
<p>Immediately after the battle an express was sent to convey the
news of our success to General Winchester, at whose camp he arrived
before daylight; and from that place another was sent to
communicate the intelligence to General Harrison.</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis was determined, if possible, to hold the place
until a reinforcement could be sent on. We knew our situation was
very critical, being only <i>eighteen</i> miles from Malden; yet it
appeared to make scarcely any impression upon our minds, so long
had we been in the region of the enemy, and so much had we suffered
from cold, hunger, and fatigue. The fare was now so different to
what we had been accustomed since we left the settlement in
Ohio&mdash;and some of the troops were so much elated with having driven
the enemy from their fortifications, and having taken possession of
their provisions, &amp;c.&mdash;that we almost seemed to forget that we
had an enemy in the world.</p>
<p>On the evening of the nineteenth, General Winchester left the
Rapids with two hundred and fifty men, which were all that could be
spared from that post. He reached us on the night of the twentieth,
and encamped in an open lot on the right of the former detachment.
Colonel Lewis had encamped in a place where he was defended by
garden pickets, which were sufficient to defend from an attack of
small arms. Colonel Wells commanded the reinforcement; and to him
the General named, but did not positively command, a breast-work
for the protection of his camp. The General himself, established
his quarters in a house upon the south side of the river; about
three hundred yards from the camp.</p>
<p>On the 21st, a place was selected for the whole detachment to
encamp, in good order, with a determination to fortify the next
day. About sunset Colonel &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; solicited and obtained leave to
return to the Rapids. On this day, certain information was obtained
that the British were preparing for an attack, and that we might
look for it in a very short time. A Frenchman came from Malden with
information that a large force of British and Indians&mdash;which he
supposed would number near three thousand&mdash;were about to march from
that place shortly after he left it. But even this was not
credited, or if believed, was little regarded by many of the
troops! The most of the men acted as though they knew themselves to
be perfectly secure; some wandering; about the town until a late
hour at night! For myself, I can say, I felt little dread, though I
had reason to believe that our situation was very perilous. I slept
soundly until awaked by the startling cry of "to arms! to arms!"
and the thundering of cannon and roar of small arms, and the more
terific yelling of savages.</p>
<p>Major Madison and Colonel Lewis, together with most of the
officers, had cautioned their men to be on their guard, and be
prepared for an attack. Guards, as usual, were placed out; but as
it was extremely cold, no picket guard was placed upon the road by
which the enemy was expected to advance. At day-break, on the
morning of the 22nd, just as the drum began to beat, three guns
were fired by the sentinels; in an instant the men were at their
posts. The British now began to open a heavy fire of cannon and
small arms. They appeared mostly to direct their cannon to the
house which contained the ammunition, and where the wounded
officers lay. Every circumstance attending this awful scene,
conspired to make it more alarming&mdash;the time and manner in which it
was commenced&mdash;for they approached in the dark with profound
silence&mdash;not a breath was heard until all was ready, then, sudden
as a flash of powder, the bloody work began.</p>
<p>The first thing that presented itself to my sight, after awaking
out of sleep and going to the window, was the fiery tail of a
bombshell&mdash;and these came in quick succession. Just at this moment,
the fire of small arms from both sides began. For a considerable
time it was one continued roar. But I could, nevertheless,
distinguish between the enemies guns and our own. The British
regulars approached immediately in front of Colonel Lewis'
detachment, but did not long remain within the reach of small arms,
for a well directed fire from the pickets soon repulsed them, with
the loss of a number of their soldiers whom they left upon the
field. They would not have approached so near if they had known
precisely our situation. They told me whilst I was at Detroit, that
they thought we were encamped in the open field outside of the
garden pickets; but as soon as it was light, and they discovered
their mistake, they retreated. The yelling of the Indians appeared
to be mostly on the right, though some was heard upon the left, but
none in the centre.</p>
<p>The reinforcement which had arrived with General Winchester, and
which was unprotected by any breastwork, after maintaining the
conflict for a short time, was overpowered and fell back. Just at
this time General Winchester came up and ordered the retreating
troops to rally and form behind the second bank of the river, and
inclining toward the centre, take refuge behind the picketing.
These orders were probably not heard, and being hard pressed both
by the British and Indians in front and on their right flank, they
were completely thrown into confusion, and retreated in disorder
over the river. A detachment which was sent from the pickets to
reinforce the right wing, and a few others who supposed the whole
army was ordered to retreat, joined in its flight. Those brave men,
Colonels Allen and Lewis, both followed, hoping to assist in
rallying the troops. An attempt was made to rally them on the south
side of the river, behind the houses and garden pickets, but all in
vain; the Indians had taken possession of the woods behind them,
and thus completely cut off their retreat, and no alternative now
remained but to stand and fight a superior force, which was every
moment accumulating, and which had every advantage, or to retreat
to better ground. In their dismay and confusion they attempted to
pass a narrow lane&mdash;the Indians were on both sides, and shot them
in every direction. A large party which had gained the woods on the
right, were surrounded and massacred without distinction.</p>
<p>Captain Watson, who was an eye-witness, states, "that after
crossing the river, they attempted to form and give battle, but the
houses being in the way, they failed in the attempt. They then
retreated through a lane for one hundred yards, on the sides of
which a number of Indians were placed, who injured them very much."
He, though wounded, joined in the retreat. He further states "that
the Indians pursued on each side for about one mile, they then fell
back in the rear." He then saw Colonel Lewis and requested him to
form the men and make a stand against the Indians once more, as
many of the men were wounded and could retreat no farther. The
attempt was made without success, as many were without arms. He
afterwards saw General Winchester, and begged of him for God's sake
to make a stand, as the Indians were in close pursuit, and he
himself was much exhausted, and was convinced that many more were
in the same condition. The General informed him that the men could
not be rallied.</p>
<p>After retreating about three miles from Raisin they came to a
field, those on foot passed through, and those on horseback rode
around. Here Captain Watson, General Winchester, Colonel Lewis,
Doctor Ervine and Doctor Patrick, were seen going slowly forward,
their horses much fatigued, and a number of Indians pursuing on
fresh horses, who soon overtook them.</p>
<p>Captain Watson, seeing the Indians within one hundred yards of
him, slipped through a fence, pulled off his shoes, ran along the
fence in a stooping position about sixty yards, and hid himself in
some high grass. The Indians continued to pursue those who were
before. He thinks there were not more than fifty men ahead of him.
After the Indians had passed by, the Captain moved to a prairie,
where he concealed himself until dark, and then pushed on to the
Rapids, keeping the road a distance to the right.</p>
<p>Mr. Newel, one of Captain Watson's company, concealed himself in
a barn, near to where the Indians returned. His account is, that
they had "a number of scalps tied to their saddles, and a number
also of our men tied." He left the barn on the 23d at night&mdash;lost
his way, and went back to the river Raisin in the night. He was
there informed that all who stood their ground had been taken
prisoners, and that but few had been killed. It is due to the
memory of Doctor Davis to notice a circumstance which was related
by one of the wounded. He stated, that at the commencement of the
action he took a gun belonging to a companion of his, also wounded,
and moved forward to join the company; the Doctor seeing him, said,
"give me the gun, your situation will not allow you to expose
yourself," and went himself into the engagement&mdash;showing his
promptness in every part of duty, whether in dressing the wounded,
or in facing the enemy as a private soldier.</p>
<p>I made inquiry of all the prisoners which I could see, about
Colonel Allen and Captain Simpson, but could hear nothing
satisfactory. I spent a year in prison with several men who were in
the retreating party, and often heard them relate what they knew of
that sad affair; but as they did not belong to our company, and
were not personally acquainted with Colonel Allen and Captain
Simpson, and as they were in such a state of alarm&mdash;all around
being dismay and confusion&mdash;they could not particularly notice any
person, but directed their whole attention toward their own
personal safety. Perhaps the whole truth relating to those brave
men, who fell in the retreating party, will never be known. It has
been related that Captain Simpson fell not far from the mouth of
the lane through which the troops had just passed. It has also been
stated of Colonel Allen: "After making several unsuccessful efforts
to rally his men&mdash;entreating them to halt, and to sell their lives
as dearly as possible&mdash;that he had retreated about two miles, until
he was exhausted; he then sat down upon a log and resigned himself
up to his fate. An Indian Chief perceiving him to be an officer of
distinction, was anxious to make him a prisoner. As soon as he came
to the Colonel, he threw his gun across his lap and told him in
Indian to surrender and he should be safe. Another savage having
advanced with a hostile appearance, Colonel Allen, with one stroke
of his sword, laid him dead at his feet. A third Indian had the
honor of shooting one of the first and bravest men of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Before we leave the retreating party, it may not be out of place
to record two circumstances which show the estimate which the
Indians set upon bravery, and also how they treat cowardice. The
circumstances were related to me as follows: A young man after the
Indians had taken him prisoner, and appeared inclined to save his
life, showed great alarm, and at length told the Indians that he
would tell them where they might find a great many white men, and
might kill them all, &amp;c. The Indians instantly took his life,
although until then they had showed no hostility toward him. The
other related to the narrator himself. He stated that after the
Indians took him prisoner, they marched him very hard, until he
became so much exhausted that he was no longer able to travel as
fast as they wished him to go. They shook their tomahawks at him,
and told him that he must march faster or die. He was starving and
sick, but he kept on as fast and as far as he could, and when he
could go no farther he laid down upon the ground and told them to
kill him. They motioned with their weapons as if they intended to
take his life, but when they saw his resolution they became
attached to him, and aided him all they could to go on the journey,
and were kind to him as long as he remained with them.</p>
<p>After the British had withdrawn their forces from our front, and
the Indians had mostly disappeared, and the firing, save a few
scattering guns from some scouting Indians, had ceased, the
situation of the retreating party became a matter of anxious
concern with Colonel Lewis' detachment, which was left within the
picketing. Some were heard to express their fears that they were
generally cut off, because of the firing heard in that direction.
During all the time the troops within the pickets stood to their
posts, and now in this critical moment fully sustained the
character of brave Kentuckians. Majors <i>Madison</i> and <i>Garrard</i>,
when the amunition grew short in the catridge boxes, were employed
busily to furnish the men with a supply, carrying them around in
their pocket handkerchiefs and strewing them upon the ground at the
soldiers' feet, and at the same time exhorting them never to think
of a surrender. Some of our brave men fell by a party of savages
coming up under the north bank of the river. From the house
containing the wounded, they were discovered. Information was given
immediately, and by a detachment they were soon routed.</p>
<p>The firing now had ceased, except a shot as an Indian was seen
passing about. The men had to keep a strict look out to prevent
surprise, as the Indians were skulking about, and no one felt safe
for a single moment. After the cannon, which had been placed down
the river about two hundred yards, had ceased firing&mdash;the horse and
driver which supplied the ammunition being killed&mdash;those of us who
had received wounds in the battle (myself among the rest,)
proceeded to take our breakfasts of a little light bread. This was
all that we could now procure.</p>
<p>All the while we were at a loss to know why the British troops
had been withdrawn to the woods, and the Indians left alone to
contend by themselves; but we afterwards learned that they were
waiting the return of the Indians who had pursued the retreating
party. When they returned they brought <i>General Winchester</i> and
<i>Colonel Lewis</i> with them.</p>
<p>As soon as General Proctor, the British commander, heard that
General Winchester was taken, he basely determined to take
advantage of it, and thereby procure the surrender of all those
within the picketing. He represented to the General that nothing
but an immediate surrender could save the Americans from an
indiscriminate Indian massacre. It was not until the flag
approached, borne by Major Overton, one of the Generals' aids,
bringing orders from General Winchester to surrender, that we
dreamed that the General, or Colonel Lewis, were prisoners. When
this news reached the troops, that General Winchester had
surrendered the whole as prisoners to the British, it was like a
shock of lightning from one end of the lines to the other. A number
declared that they never would submit, let the consequences be what
they might. But when they found that Majors Madison and Garrard had
consented to obey the orders of General Winchester, some of them,
in great rage, threw down their guns with such force as: to shiver
the stocks from the barrels.</p>
<p>When the flag above named was first discovered to advance,
various conjectures were entertained of the design. The greater
number supposed that the enemy was tired of the game and wished to
quit, and desired permission to bury their dead, which were not
few. There were also many badly wounded. It was plain to discover
where their lines had been formed, by the number of killed and
wounded still lying on the field.</p>
<p>When Major Madison approached the flag, Colonel Proctor, with
great haughtiness, demanded an immediate surrender, or he would set
the town on fire, and that the Indians should not be restrained
from committing an indiscriminate massacre. Major Madison observed
"that it had been customary for the Indians to massacre the wounded
prisoners after a surrender," and "that he could not agree to any
capitulation which General Winchester might direct, unless the
safety and protection of his men were secured." Colonel Proctor
then said, "Sir, do you mean to dictate for me?" "No," replied
Madison, "I mean to dictate for <i>myself</i>&mdash;and we prefer to sell
our lives as dearly as possible, rather than be massacred in cold
blood." Proctor then agreed to receive a surrender upon the terms,
that all private property should be respected&mdash;that sleds should be
sent next morning to remove the sick and wounded to
Amherstburg&mdash;and that in the mean time they should be protected by
a guard, and the side arms should be restored to the officers at
Malden.</p>
<p>But this unprincipled deceiver, bearing the title of General,
suffered the savages to violate the treaty before his own eyes.
Whilst the men were in parade to surrender their arms in order, the
Indians began to tear up the tents and to plunder in every
direction gathering up every thing in the shape of clothing, and
every knapsack which they could find. I could not bear arms from my
wound, and whilst the men were on parade, some time before they
were marched off, I was passing about and noticing the movements
and work of the Indians. They were striving who should get the most
plunder. I passed around to the front of the house to take a look
at the boys before they left us; they braved it off as well as
might have been expected. Some looked a little dejected&mdash;others
joked and laughed. One, who had not yet fallen into the ranks, was
standing upon a stile-block, and said to the English: "Well, you
have taken the greatest set of game cocks that ever came from
Kentuck." I wish I could remember his name&mdash;he was calculated to
remind one of a game cock.</p>
<p><i>John Locke</i> and <i>Jesse Fisher</i>, of our company, were badly
wounded; and as both Proctor and Elliott had promised to send sleds
for us in the morning, and though able to walk myself, I resolved
to risk it, and stay and assist those who were not able to help
themselves. <i>Captain Hart</i>, of Lexington, Kentucky, expressed great
anxiety to be taken with the prisoners to Malden. His men offered
to carry him, and were reluctant to leave him behind; but Colonel
Elliott, the commander of the Indians, being well acquainted with
Hart and his family&mdash;having in former life received great favors
from them in Kentucky&mdash;assured him that he need not be under the
least apprehension of danger&mdash;that the Indians would not molest
those that were left&mdash;and that, upon the honor of a soldier, he
would send his own sleigh for him on the next morning and have him
conveyed to Malden.</p>
<p>Some of the more discerning apprehended great danger in being
left, and insisted on all that could go to do so. The brave Captain
Hickman saw the danger, and desired all that could walk not to
remain; for, said he to Mr. Holton, (now Captain Holton,) "there
are more of us here now than will ever get away." This, from what I
could afterwards learn, was the sentiment entertained and expressed
by all the officers. But what could they do in their wounded and
defenceless condition, being no doubt doomed to death by the
infamous Proctor and Elliott.</p>
<p>These brave officers and soldiers, who had battled against the
very elements for months, and had passed through sufferings almost
equal to death itself, lived through it all only to meet the most
horrid of all deaths&mdash;of being butchered in cold blood, and that
without having the power or means of defence.</p>
<p>The parting was a solemn one, and not only solemn, but in
reference to most of those unhappy victims, it was final. Many were
greatly affected, especially the friends of Hart and Hickman. But
having fallen into the hands of a bloody and heartless tyrant, this
brave "Spartan band" were compelled to submit to his cruel
dictates.</p>
<p>No time was now to be lost&mdash;all eyes were directed towards the
Rapids&mdash;the cowardly Proctor dreaded the approach of General
Harrison, and therefore made all possible speed to get out of his
way, fearing to meet so brave and experienced an officer; and well
he might, for the sight of General Harrison at that time would have
been death to the hopes and prospects of these red and white
savages, while it would have been a jubilee to those hapless
Kentuckians who were doomed to death.</p>
<p>After a few formalities of delivering up arms, &amp;c., they
were hurried off and driven like so many beasts to market, but with
much less tenderness and kindness than a merciful man would show to
his beast. After their arrival at Malden, they were crowded into a
pen, and there guarded, without anything to protect them from the
weather. Their bread, what little they got, was thrown to them like
throwing corn to swine.</p>
<p>Though there was a much shorter rout by which the prisoners
might have been returned to their own country, yet this did not
satisfy these wanton tyrants&mdash;nothing would do but the prisoners
must, in the dead of winter, march on foot up Detroit river; thence
up the Thames, to Delaware town; thence across the country to
Burlington Heights; and from this point to Fort Niagara&mdash;a distance
perhaps of five hundred miles&mdash;when the whole could have been
accomplished in about two days' march, by sending them back to the
Rapids, where they would have fallen in with their friends at once.
But no,&mdash;nothing but the infliction of suffering would satisfy
those cruel tyrants.</p>
<p>These things are but barely mentioned, that the attention of the
young and rising generation may be led to reflect upon them. And
that they may have some knowledge of what their fathers suffered in
defence of the liberties they now so richly enjoy.</p>
<p>After the men were marched off every thing was quiet; now and
then an Indian was seen straying about as though seeking plunder.
They did not manifest hostility, and our fears began to subside,
and we hoped to be conveyed to the army on the next morning.</p>
<p>Doctors Todd and Bowers were left to take care of the wounded.
Major Reynolds and and three interpreters composed the only guard
to protect the wounded from the savages. We were hoping that
General Harrison, then on his way from the Rapids, would just at
that time arrive and give us relief by his reinforcement. Major
Reynolds was evidently uneasy lest Harrison should arrive. Some of
the Indians staid in town until late in the night. Major Reynolds
and the interpreters left some time in the night; at least they
left our house, and we saw them no more.</p>
<p>As night came on, our fears began to increase. An Indian came
into the house and told us that he thought there was danger to be
feared from some Indians, which he thought were disposed to do
mischief. He manifested some uneasiness himself; perhaps fearing
that some Indian might shoot into the house. He appeared to be well
acquainted with the affairs of the Indians, in general, and had
some knowledge of the movements and designs of the British and
American armies&mdash;which he was not at all backward in expressing. He
spoke the English language fluently; and from his manners, I would
infer that he had spent much of his life with the white population.
His principal object seems to have been to gain all the information
possible about General Harrison, and the strength of the
Northwestern army. It is probable, however, that another object of
his visit was to find out from us whether we thought it probable
that General Harrison would advance immediately with the main body
of his army to make an attack upon Malden. He gained but little
information from us. There was but one man of our company
thoughtless enough to give any <i>correct</i> information, whose name I
shall not mention. He told us many things about Tecumseh and the
Indians from the north that were coming to join them in the spring.
He seemed to entertain no doubt but that they would, when all their
forces were brought together, find it an easy matter to conquer all
the armies the United States could send to the north. After
remaining in our room about two hours, he very politely bid us good
night, and left us.</p>
<p>After the departure of this Indian chief, (for I have but little
doubt but what he was among the principal leaders of the Indian
forces,) some conversation ensued among ourselves in reference to
the designs of this crafty and intelligent chief.</p>
<p>There was, as well as I can recollect, but one opinion expressed
on the subject; and I believe it was the opinion of all, that that
would be the last night with most of us. We dreaded an attack
during the night; for this Indian, just as he left, said "I am
afraid some of the mischievious boys will do some mischief before
morning." After remaining in this state of suspense for more than
an hour, expecting every moment that the savages would come rushing
upon us; but every thing becoming quiet, we laid down upon our
blankets to rest: but rested very little during this dismal night.
Dreadful as was the night, the morning was more fearful. Just as
the sun had risen upon us, and our hopes began to rise; and just as
we were about to eat the morsel of bread left us by our friends who
had been marched off the day before, that we might be ready at a
moments warning to leave, should the British send sleighs for us,
we heard a noise in the passage, and before we had time to think,
the door of our room was forced open by an Indian, who entered with
tomahawk in hand, ready to commence his bloody work. He was quickly
followed by others. Their first object was plunder. They had no
sooner entered the door of our room, than they began, in the most
cruel manner, to strip the blankets and clothes off the wounded as
they lay upon the floor. Fortunately for me, I was at the opposite
side of the room from the door at which the Indians entered, near a
door leading into the front room of the house; and finding there
was no time to lose, I immediately passed out into the front room,
where I met one of the most savage looking Indians I ever beheld.
His very appearance was enough to terrify the stoutest heart. His
face painted as black as charcoal could make it, plainly indictive
of his deadly design; a bunch of long feathers fastened on his
head, almost as large as a half bushel; a large tomahawk, the
instrument of death, in his right hand; a scalping knife fastened
to his belt. He instanly seized me by the collar, and led me out at
the front door. At first I manifested some unwillingness to go with
him. He then spoke very earnestly in his own language, and at the
same time pulled me along forcibly, as if to remove me from the
scene of death within. He led me through the front gate, and down
the river about one hundred yards to the other houses, in which
were Captains <i>Hart</i>, <i>Hickman</i>, and others. After leading me
through the front gate, he left me. Just at this time, Captain Hart
came out of his room, barefooted, with nothing on but shirt and
drawers. In this condition he stood in the snow for some length of
time pleading for his life. I here met with the chief who had been
in our room in the evening. Captain <i>Hart</i> understanding the
designs of Proctor and Elliott, and knowing that the only possible
chance for life, under the circumstances, was to make some
arrangement with the Indians. For this purpose he sought an
interview with this one, as he seemed to be a leader, and very
intelligent. They met in the front yard, near the gate, about the
time I came in.</p>
<p>I stood by and heard the conversation. Captain Hart's first
remark, if I mistake not, was, that he was an acquaintance of
Colonel Elliott's, and that he (Elliott) had promised to send his
own sleigh for him. The Indian replied, "Elliott has deceived
you&mdash;he does not intend to fulfill his promise." Well, said Capt.
Hart, "if you will agree to take me, I will give you a horse, or a
hundred dollars. You shall have it on our arrival at Malden." The
Indian said, "<i>I cannot take you</i>." "Why?" asked Captain Hart. "You
are too badly wounded," said the Indian. Captain Hart then asked
the Indian, what they intended to do with them? "Boys," said the
Indian, raising himself up into an attitude and air of consequence
and insult, "<i>your are all to be killed</i>." Though involved in the
same calamity myself, I could but notice the calmness and composure
with which the brave officer received the sentence of death. The
only reply which I heard him make was in the language of prayer to
Almighty God to sustain him in this hour of trial. Feeling that the
awful sentence included myself as well as all the rest, my heart
seemed to sink within me, expecting every moment to receive the
fatal blow. Just at this moment an Indian dragged Captain Hickman
out of the house by one arm, and threw him down near where I stood,
with his face on the snow. He was tomahawked, but not yet dead. He
lay strangling in his blood. From this scene I turned away, and
walking round the end of the house, towards the back yard, met an
Indian at the corner of the house, who took hold of me and searched
my pockets for money, but finding none, passed on. I then passed on
round the house, leaving the main building on my right, and walking
slowly that I might not appear to have any design, and that I might
not attract the attention of the enemy. I thought, possibly, I
might reach a small log building which I discovered not far from
the house. As there was but one small entrance into it, and as it
appeared dark within, it seemed to present the only possible
refuge; and as there was no time to lose, and as life and death
were depending, I determined to make the attempt to gain this place
of retreat. But as I was within a few paces of my hiding place, an
Indian coming from the opposite direction met me, and taking hold
of me, asked me where I was wounded: I placed my hand upon my
shoulder. He then felt of it, and finding that the wound was not
bad, he took me back to the house where he had deposited his
plunder; put a blanket around me, gave me a hat, then took me to
the back door of the house in which the wounded lay, and gave me
his gun and plunder in charge. In a moment every thing seemed to
wear a different aspect. I now experienced one of those sudden
transitions of mind impossible to be either conceived or expressed,
except by those whose unhappy lot it has been, to be placed in like
circumstances. Until now, despair had spread its gloomy mantle over
me; but hope, that cheering companion, again visited my sinking
heart, and I again saw a faint prospect that my life <i>might</i> be
spared. Thus situated, I had time to see what was passing around
me. I had command of the way leading to Malden; and I saw but one
road. I remained in this position about two hours, during which
time I saw several pass&mdash;I suppose all who were able. Here I saw a
striking example of the estimate a man places on life. I saw some
of our own company&mdash;old acquaintances who were so badly wounded
that they could scarcely be moved in their beds, understanding that
those who could not travel on foot to Malden were all to be
tomahawked, pass on their way to Malden, hobbling along on sticks.
Poor fellows, they were soon overtaken by their merciless enemies
and inhumanly butchered. A few moments after, being placed here by
the Indian who claimed me, another Indian set fire to the house.
The fire was built in the passage near the backdoor where I stood.
After the fire had taken considerable hold of the house, an Indian
came running down stairs with a keg of powder in his hand, with the
head out. Just as he got to the foot of the stairs his foot
slipped, and he come very near falling into the fire with the
powder. Had the powder caught, both he and I would have
perished.</p>
<p>The general opinion, I believe is, in reference to Captain Hart,
that an Indian engaged to take him to Malden; and that another
Indian, unwilling that he should go, shot him on the road. This may
be true, but has always appeared to me improbable. From the
position I occupied, having command of the way to Malden, I believe
I saw all who passed in that direction, but saw nothing of Captain
Hart. Upon the whole, I am induced to think that Captain Hart met
his fate in the front yard where I left him.</p>
<p>I remained here until the roof of the house set on fire had
fallen in. I heard no cry within, from which I infered that the
wounded were killed before the house was burnt.</p>
<p>My Indian finally returned, bringing with him one of the United
States' pack horses; and placing his bundle of plunder on him, gave
me the bridle, making signs to march on towards Malden. I soon
found the bodies of those poor hapless boys who had made the
attempt, but were too badly wounded to travel, massacred, scalped,
and stripped. When we reached the woods, we halted a short time by
the fire. We then went on to Stony creek, where the British had
encamped the night before the battle. Their wounded were still
there, waiting to be conveyed to Malden.</p>
<p>Here the Indians made a large fire of rails, and gave the
prisoners some bread. Our number was eight or ten. As we were
eating, one of the Indians deliberately walked up to his prisoner,
a fine looking young man, a son of Dr. Blythe of Lexington, and
struck the tomahawk into his head. I was looking the young man in
the face when he received the deadly blow; he closed his eyes, and
sunk under the first stroke of the deadly weapon. After he had
fallen, and received two or three strokes from the hand of the
Indian, an old Frenchman took the weapon out of the hand of the
savage and gave the dying man another stroke upon the head, which
stilled him in death.<a name=footnotecall></a><a href="#footnote">*</a></p>
<p>This greatly alarmed us. There appeared to be nothing in his
case, that we could see, that made it necessary for him to die and
not the rest of us. We now expected every moment to share the same
barbarity. One of our company, a young man by the name of Jones,
was so terified that he began to weep, and moved to the opposite
side of the fire, thinking that those nearest the danger would be
the first victims. We urged him to be still, and not to discover
such marks of fear, or that he would certainly be killed. The
Indian who had taken me, and claimed me as his, was at this time a
few steps from us, adjusting his pack; I stepped up to him, and
asked him if they were going to kill us all. He answered "<i>yes</i>." I
went back to the fire and tried to eat, as well as I could, without
an appetite. It was now about two o'clock, P. M., and having eaten
but little for three days past, and that day had taken nothing
until we arrived at Stony creek; but this awful cold-blooded
butchery took away all desire for food. I soon saw that he did not
understand my question, and I was then somewhat relieved. It has
been said, and perhaps with due regard to truth, that many of the
Indians engaged in this dreadful havoc, were under the influence of
rum. They were supplied with it by the British, and when under its
influence were more savage than savages.</p>
<p>We now took up our march towards Malden, leaving some of the
Indians and their prisoners behind. Some of them I saw no more.
They may have shared the same fate at the fire as the young man
above. He was as able to travel as any of us, being only slightly
wounded. He had no shoes&mdash;this may have been the reason why they
did not take him on. We had gone but a short distance until we came
to a number of Indians who were dancing the war dance around the
fire. Here some of them had encamped on the night before the
battle. As soon as we arrived, I saw that the Indians were drunk.
Here my fears were again alarmed&mdash;being in the midst of a savage
camp&mdash;dancing the war dance&mdash;the blood of scores fresh upon
them&mdash;and under the influence of strong drink! Whilst my Indian
kept sober I had some hopes of protection. It was not loner however
until I saw him go into the dance and begin to drink. Now I almost
yielded myself up to despair. As I stood holding his horse with a
sad countenance, he came to me and gave me a roasted potato. He
also made some expression of friendship, which once more tended to
revive my drooping hopes.</p>
<p>The Indians having finished their dance, we proceeded towards
Malden, and at night we encamped in the woods upon the snow. We
took supper upon a piece cut from the side of a hog, boiled with
the hair on, without bread and without salt. It rained during the
night, and our situation was anything but agreeable; yet I felt
thankful that it was no worse.</p>
<p>Many strange reflections rolled across my mind during the
evening. The scenes of the day&mdash;such as I had never before
witnessed&mdash;would occasionally force themselves upon my mind, the
tendency of which was to spread a gloom upon every thing around me,
and to heighten my fears. We were in a dense forest, removed from
the sight of any habitation of man, the snow about eighteen inches
deep, the rain making it still more insupportable.</p>
<p>I kept my eyes upon the Indians, particularly the one to whom I
belonged, watching every motion, every step, and expression of his
countenance. As the shades of night began to close upon our gloomy
retreat, it seemed to shed a double horror upon the scene. The sad
and heart-chilling thought would, in spite of all the efforts I
could make to frown it back, intrude itself upon me, that I had
been saved from the massacre only to meet a more horrid fate&mdash;that
the fire they had kindled was perhaps to serve the double purpose
of cooking their supper and roasting me to death. Whenever any of
the company would take his tomahawk in his hand, the thought would
instantly spring up, now I am gone.</p>
<p>This, take it altogether, was among the most trying scenes
through which I passed during my imprisonment; not that I was
actually in more danger, but taking all the circumstances
together&mdash;the place, the time, and being separated from my friends
in suffering, and being thrown alone, and for the first time to be
secluded from all but a few savages whose hands were yet stained
with the blood of my countrymen, and not knowing the moment my own
might be shed&mdash;produced emotions extremely distressing and
trying.</p>
<p>After we had eaten, the Indians began to make preparations for
lodging, by scraping away the snow and placing bark down upon which
to spread their blankets; they suspended a blanket, by means of a
few poles, so as to keep the rain out of our faces. After engaging
themselves in conversation for some sime, which they seemed to
enjoy exceedingly, and which was occasionally accompanied with loud
exultations, the proposition was made to retire for the night. My
feelings now became indescribable. Strange as it may appear, I was
apprehensive that after I fell asleep they would take that
opportunity to despatch me; a death of this kind appeared to me the
most dreadful of all others. With these feelings, by their
direction I lay down, and knowing that they were careful to save
all articles of clothing, I tied up my head in my pocket
handkerchief, hoping that this might be some protection, believing
that they would not tomahawk me without removing it, which I
supposed they could not do without awaking me. Thus I lay me down
by the side, and under the same blanket, with the Indian who
claimed me, with fearful apprehensions that I should never again
see the light of the sun. But notwithstanding the cold, the snow
and rain, and my perilous condition, such had been the excitement
of the day that I was completely overcome, and very soon fell into
a sound sleep, and slept sweetly until morning. The light of the
morning was hailed with expressions of gratitude to a kind and
merciful Providence which had shielded me through such a night.
With the return of the day I had a return of hope that I should yet
be spared.</p>
<p>Early next morning we started on through the snow, mud and
water. We had but little to eat, and no opportunity to warm; my
clothing was scant, and not sufficient to protect me against the
weather. We fell in with several small companies of Indians, some
on foot and others on horseback, none offering any violence or
showing any hostility, but all appearing anxious to look at me and
make inquiries. Occasionally we heard a gun on the right or left;
but when we got into the vicinity of Malden the firing was almost
incessant&mdash;it seemed that the whole face of the country was covered
with Indians, rejoicing over a vanquished enemy. I again began to
feel that my condition was exceedingly perilous, and that I was
only spared from the tomahawk at Raisin, to be led to the slaughter
at Malden. Though I did not at this time fear so much from the
Indian that claimed me as his, yet I had much to fear from the
enraged and drunken savages which were to be seen in every
direction.</p>
<p>A short time before night, as we were passing an old house, a
squaw came out crying, and commenced beating me with all her
strength. She smote me on my wounded shoulder, and raised my
temper. For a short time I cared but little whether I lived or
died, I thought if this was to be my treatment whenever I met a
squaw, that I might as well give up at once and die. This was,
however, my first and last whipping from a female Indian. That
night we lodged at the house of a Frenchman, whose family was very
kind. We went forward again next morning, and that day we reached
the home of this Indian.</p>
<p>But on our way, having to pass the vicinity of Detroit, the
Indians called at the house of the old Frenchman who had stained
his hands in the blood of young Mr. Blythe, at Stony creek&mdash;(I have
since learned that this was the name of the young man.) They held a
long conversation which I could not understand, because they
conversed in Indian. The Frenchman seemed to enter heartily into
the spirit of rejoicing. They smoked together, and passed other
Indian compliments, all of which I noticed particularly; and not
only that, but marked the place, and promised myself that if
opportunity should offer, to pay him for it.</p>
<p>From this point we left the main road, leaving Detroit to our
right; we soon passed through a large Indian camp; just as we were
entering, a company came in who had been at the battle at Raisin,
bringing in their wounded in sleighs; the one which I saw appeared
to be very badly wounded, and contrary to all Indian custom, or
dignity of Indian character, was heard to groan. But
notwithstanding his extreme pain, he cast a most savage look at me
as the sleigh passed.</p>
<p>In passing this camp many Indians came to the door of their
tents to look, particularly the young squaws. Under all the
circumstances, passing through just as they were, returning from
the bloody scene of Raisin, and also bringing in some badly,
perhaps mortally, wounded, I had fearful apprehensions&mdash;I knew not
what moment an enraged savage would take my life.</p>
<p>After leaving this camp&mdash;at which we made no stay&mdash;I felt
greatly relieved, believing there was some hope that we might pass
safely on to our place of destination. As well as I recollect, we
passed but very few Indians after this; but about sunset, when
within a short distance of our Indian home, in passing over a pond
on the ice, which at that time was covered with snow, the horse
slipped and fell, but after some difficulty we succeeded in getting
him on his feet again, and soon reached the vicinity of camp, which
was announced to me by the Indian commencing the war-whoop at the
top of his voice, which was responded to by a number of voices as
loud and terrible as his own. All seemed to understand it&mdash;it was
the sound of victory. As soon as we approached near enough to be
recognized, every Indian, male and female, were out&mdash;all eyes
directed towards us&mdash;and every man and boy shouted to the extent of
their ability.</p>
<p>My feelings by this time&mdash;having recently witnessed so many
scenes of blood, and having passed through so many hair-breadth
escapes myself&mdash;had become almost deadened; but upon the approach
of this camp, amid the shouts of savages, and not knowing for what
purpose I should be brought there, unless to be a victim of sport
for them, I <i>felt</i>, and this is all that I can say&mdash;for to express
<i>what</i> I felt, I find to be impossible.</p>
<p>Here we found the home of his wife, and her father and mother,
who all seemed glad to see us. The old squaw took me by the hand
and led me into the hut, and gave me something to eat, which was in
place. I now began to feel that I had friends in this family, and
considered myself pretty safe. We spent about two weeks at this
place, a few miles west of Detroit. A day or two before we left
this encampment the Indians determined on having a spree. They went
to Detroit and traded for a keg of rum. They had not been at home
long until most of the men were drunk. I now again felt myself in
danger, for one of them attempted to take my life; I escaped
because he was drunk and could not get to me. That night the squaws
hid me out in the woods behind a log in the snow. They made me a
bed of hay, and covered me with their blankets. When I awaked in
the morning the frolic was all over. The Indians were lying about
round the fires like hounds after a hard chase; the whiskey was
dying in them, and they were sleepy and sick. The Indians now made
ready to go out to their hunting ground; and after a few days'
preparation we started. As well as I am able to judge, we travelled
a west course. We were upon the road about two weeks; our
sufferings were great from the intense cold, and from hunger; we
had nothing to eat but what the hunters could kill by the way. I
rendered what assistance I could in catching raccoons and
porcupines, for these were our principal living whilst on the road.
I suppose we travelled one hundred and fifty miles before we
reached our destination. We now began to fare a little better,
though we sometimes still suffered with hunger&mdash;it was either a
<i>feast</i> or a <i>famine</i> with us. The Indians would eat up all the
provisions with as much despatch as possible, and let every day
provide for itself. Thus we spent our time for several weeks.</p>
<p>Here I will give an account of a very aged man who I saw on our
way out to this place. There were many families on the way at the
same time&mdash;not only their wives and children, but their young men.
This caused me to think that they did not expect any more war
during the winter season. It seemed that when their actual services
were not necessary, they were then left to shift for themselves.
This was in perfect character with all the doings of the British
during this war. We had been travelling near a week, and our
hunters were so fortunate as now to kill a deer. We encamped at the
foot of a hill, so as to be screened by it from the keen northern
blasts, and have the benefit of the sun. During our stay at this
camp, the old Chief killed another deer, which, with raccoons and
porcupines, afforded us plenty of food. The Indians made an
offering of the oil, and part of the flesh of the deer, to the
<i>Great Spirit</i>, by burning it. This I took to be their thank
offering for their success in finding a supply of provisions.
Before they left the encampment they burned some tobacco; the
design of this I did not so well understand. Soon after we began to
march, I saw the marks of a cane in the snow, and as the Indians do
not use them, I supposed we were overtaking some prisoners. The
second day after I saw the cane tracks, we came up with a company
of Indians, and here I saw the old Indian who had the cane. The
moment I saw him my attention was arrested by his very grave and
ancient appearance. His head was whitened over with, I have no
doubt, the frosts of more than one hundred winters, and still he
travelled, and kept pace with the horses and young men, from
morning till evening. This was the most aged Indian which I saw
during my sojourn with them. Their old men are much more vigorous
and free from infirmity than ours. They walk erect, and command
great respect from all the younger&mdash;their counsel is heard with
profound attention and respect.</p>
<p>During the month of March the Indians sent to their town for
corn. We fared better now, but the corn did not last long; so we
were soon thrown back upon what game we could kill in the
forests.</p>
<p>From what I could learn, the Indians had adopted me into their
family, in the room of a young man who had fallen in battle. Soon
after we reached this, the place of our winter quarters, the
father-in-law of my Indian dressed me up in Indian costume, made me
a bow and arrows, and started me out with his boys to learn to
shoot. I was then in the twenty first year of my age. This was our
exercise during the cold weather, and afforded me much amusement,
as I had none with whom I could converse. We had many a hunt
through the woods with our bows and arrows, but I could not learn
to use them to much purpose. Sometimes I was permitted to have a
gun, and go on a hunting expedition, but was always unsuccessful&mdash;I
could kill no game. I once saw the Indians proceed to kill a bear
which had holed himself up for the winter. The scratches upon the
bark was the sign. They then surrounded the tree, and all being
ready, they gave a loud yell; the bear appeared, we all fired
instantly, and among hands the bear came tumbling down. Soon after
this, our old Chief killed a very large bear&mdash;one of uncommon size
even in that country, where they were large and plenty. He brought
home a part of it, and on the next day sent out three of his sons,
an old man who lived in the family, and myself, to bring in the
remainder. The snow was deep, and we had to travel three or four
miles to the place. We took our loads and started to camp. The old
Indian mentioned above had on snow shoes in order to walk without
sinking; the toe of one of his shoes caught in a small snag which
threw him face foremost into the snow, and being heavily laden with
bear meat, the strap to which it was suspended came over his arms,
and made it very difficult for him to rise. Without thinking where
I was, and the danger I was in, I laughed at the old man struggling
under the heavy pressure of his bear meat. Fortunately he did not
perceive me; one of the young men shook his head at me, giving me
to understand that I was risking my life. I discovered that he was
also amused, but was afraid to manifest it. Our hut was now well
supplied with meat, the finest that the country could furnish. I
flattered myself that we should not want soon again; but to my
utter astonishment, our old squaw, my Indian's mother-in-law, sat
up the whole night and cooked every ounce of it! And worse yet&mdash;to
my great discouragement, the neighbors were called in next morning,
bringing wooden dishes along with them, and after many ceremonies,
the whole was divided between the company, who eat what they could
and packed off the balance.</p>
<p>There were times when we were very scarce of provisions. On one
occasion, I remember, we had for dinner a small piece of bear meat,
which, I suppose, had been sent in by some of the neighbors. Our
old mother cooked and placed it in a wooden bowl, which was all the
china we had. Our dog was looking on with interest, being nearly
starved; and when the old lady turned her back, he sprang in upon
the meat and started with it in his mouth. The old squaw, with
great presence of mind, seized him by the throat to prevent him
from swallowing it. She succeeded, and replacing it in the bowl, we
eat it, and were glad to get it. The Indian women are doomed to a
hard life. They do the drudgery. In removing from one camp to
another, they pack the goods and children&mdash;the men carrying only
their guns. I have seen the women wade into the water to their
waists in cold freezing weather.</p>
<p>Among the Indians, I saw several persons who had lost the tip of
their nose. This was strange, especially among the females. But
since, when I was in Detroit, I learned that this was a mode of
punishing adultery and fornication among some tribes. I am unable
to vouch for the correctness of this statement.</p>
<p>I will here give the reader the history of a corn dance which
took place sometime this winter. Our squaws had brought in some
corn from the towns. The neighbors were called together, neither to
eat, nor drink, but to dance. Considerable preparations were made.
Every thing was removed from near the large fire that was burning
in the centre. The company consisted of grown persons only. One was
chosen to make music, which he did by singing and rattling a gourd
with shot, or beans in it. They danced round the fire in single
file, the men in front. The women, whilst dancing, keep their feet
close together, and perform the exercise by jumping. The men sling
their arms most violently and awkardly, and stamp their feet so as
to make the earth sound. They kept up this exercise until a late
hour in the night. All seemed to partake of the joy, which they
considered to be of a sacred character. It was a thanksgiving for a
supply of corn, and the near approach of spring. This dance was
finished by a young Indian, selected for the purpose, who performed
the closing exercise with great animation. They now all quietly
returned to their homes without taking any kind of refreshment.</p>
<p>I soon become satisfied that man in a state of nature labored
under many and serious disadvantages, particularly in the art of
preparing their food. Though modern refinement has no doubt carried
this matter too far, we may with safety venture to say that man in
an uncultivated state falls as far below what is fit and proper for
human health and comfort as refinement has gone beyond.</p>
<p>The very best they can do is to make their corn into a kind of
small homony, which they do by the very hardest method, that of
pounding it in a mortar&mdash;and this labor is performed by the
women&mdash;after which it is boiled something like half an hour, when
it is eaten without salt or any thing else with it. But frequently
it is prepared without this process, by boiling the corn just as it
comes from the ear until a little softened. They seem perfectly
satisfied with this alone, once or twice a day without any thing
else, for they scarcely ever eat meat and corn at the same time.
But they eat most enormous quantities, without any apparent rule as
to time or quantity. I have known them to eat several times
heartily in the course of a few hours; and perhaps the next day
hunt all day without eating any thing at all. I think it probable
that it would hardly have taken all that we saw and experienced to
have satisfied even Volney himself, that the civilized is greatly
to be prefered to the savage life.</p>
<p>At this camp I also witnessed the mode of cleansing their
bodies. They bent hickory poles in the form of wagon bows, and
covered them over with blankets. They then took with them a bowl of
water and a large hot stone. Two went in together; they poured the
water upon the hot rock, and remained within fifteen or twenty
minutes, sometimes singing and rattling the old shot gourd. They
would then come forth covered with sweat, and sometimes plunge
themselves instantly into the river which was at hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be proper here to notice the mode of worship of
the Indians. I speak only of the outer form: I know but little of
the object of their worship as I did not understand their language.
There appears to be some similarity between them and the Jews.
Their sacrifices and fasts are frequent. Their fasts are promptly
and faithfully attended to. Only one member, however, of the family
fasts at a time, which he does for several days together, eating
nothing until the afternoon. They treat their females at the birth
of their children in a way to remind one of the Jewish custom. See
Lev. 12 chap. At such times&mdash;let the season be as it may&mdash;the woman
is compelled to camp out in the woods by herself, and there remain
for a certain number of days. And when she is allowed to return to
the camp of the family, she must cook in a separate vessel for so
many days longer.</p>
<p>Our old man was very fervent in his devotions, especially in his
prayers. I never saw anything like idolatry among them.</p>
<p>They are particularly careful to entertain strangers. They are
also very hospitable among themselves&mdash;they will divide the last
morsel with each other. Indians travelling, find homes wherever
they find wigwams. If there is only provision enough for one, the
stranger gets it, and gets it freely. When any are fortunate in
hunting, and it is known to them that others want provisions, they
send them a part of theirs without waiting for them to send for
it.</p>
<p>You have been presented with the manner in which we spent our
time during the cold weather, until sugar-making came on; and now
we found work enough. We removed to a beautiful grove of sugar
trees, and near the centre of it we pitched our camp, which is the
Indian mode. We soon made a quantity of sugar, and some of a fine
quality. We used molasses and sugar with our venison and bear meat;
and sometimes we made our meals upon sugar and bear's oil, which
was better living than the reader might suppose without being
acquainted with the dish.</p>
<p>The Indians are sometimes very filthy in their diet. They will
kill a deer and take out the entrails, rip them up, turn out the
contents, shake them a few times in the snow, throw them for a few
moments upon the fire, and devour them like hungry dogs. When they
kill a deer with young, the young are considered as a choice dish.
They roast them whole. They will eat every animal, and at every
part of it, from the bear to the polecat.</p>
<p>Shortly after the breaking of the ice, the old father, one son,
and myself, left camp for an otter hunt. We ascended the river,
placing traps where we discovered that otters had passed up and
down the banks. This we did during the first day, leaving them
until our return. We encamped during the first night on the bank of
the river. We had nothing to eat. We spent the whole of the second
day in hunting, without any success; it was a cold rainy day, and
we lay down the second night without a mouthful to eat. On the
morning of the third day the old man left the camp very early, and
about twelve o'clock returned, bringing with him two pheasants;
they were put into the pot immediately. I feared my portion would
be small, as the Indians, when hungry, eat most enormously; but
another pheasant was heard near the camp, which the Indian
succeeded in killing. It was soon in the pot, and fearing lest the
Indians should eat up theirs and then want mine, I did not wait
until it was properly cooked before I went to work upon it. We soon
devoured the three pheasants without either bread or salt. After
this fine dinner we returned to camp again. We examined our traps
but found no game.</p>
<p>The spring of the year now came&mdash;the ice and snow began fast to
disappear&mdash;and I now began to think more of home than I had done
during the cold season. When the sun began to shine warm, and the
birds to sing around me, I would often retire from the camp where I
could think of home, and weep, without being discovered. During the
time spent in these lonely retreats, which I sought often for the
purpose of reflection, <i>Shelbyville, Kentucky</i>, the place of my
home, would rise up before my mind with all its inhabitants and
endearments. I would think of friends and youthful associates&mdash;of
the green over which I had played when a boy a school&mdash;and of the
church to which I gave my hand as a seeker of religion a few months
before I left; and of my aged parents, who I knew needed my
assistance. These reflections crowding upon me at once, together
with the difficulty and danger of making an escape, would at times
almost overwhelm me with sorrow and despair. But the kindness and
sympathy manifested toward me by the Indians, and particularly by
the wife of the man who took me a prisoner, took off a part of the
burthen. This poor heathen woman, who knew nothing of civilization,
and the softening influences of the Gospel, nevertheless showed
that the tenderness and affection which the Gospel requires were
deeply imprinted upon her heart. I had another source of comfort: I
found among the Indians a piece of a newspaper printed at
<i>Lexington, Kentucky</i>, which I suppose had wrapped up the clothes
of some of Captain Hart's men, and thus fell into the hands of the
Indians at Raisin. This I read over and over, again and again. I
would frequently try to learn the Indians the letters and their
sounds; this to them was a very pleasing employment.</p>
<p>The Indians now began to prepare to return to Detroit. This was
very encouraging to me, for I now began again to indulge a hope
that one day I should yet be free, and reach my friends at home.
All hands turned out to making bark canoes. We made two for each
large family. In these canoes we ascended the river upon which we
had for some time been encamped, until we came to the very head
spring&mdash;I had no means of ascertaining the name of this river&mdash;we
then took up our canoes and carried them three or four miles, to
the head waters of a river that empties into lake Erie between the
rivers Raisin and Detroit. The ridge over which we carried our
canoes divides the waters of lake Michigan and lake Erie. After
entering this stream we advanced finely, finding fish in great
abundance. I now began to feel quite cheerful, and things put on a
different aspect. This was one of the most beautiful little rivers
I ever beheld&mdash;I could see the fish at the bottom where the water
was ten feet in depth&mdash;its beauty was much heightened by passing
through several small lakes, the waters of which always
enlarged&mdash;perhaps increased its waters one half. These lakes were
bordered round by various kinds of shrubbery bending over the
water. It was now, as near as I could guess, about the first of
May, and the scenes were indeed beautiful to one who had been
freezing and starving in a northern winter, almost naked&mdash;and now
turning, as he fondly hoped, his face homeward. I became more and
more anxious to escape, as the prospect opened before me. I had
several times formed in my mind plans by which I thought I might
escape, but being young and unacquainted with the woods, and
knowing that I must be a distance from any of our forts, I was
afraid to attempt it; but now, as I believed I was not far from
Fort Meigs, I determined to make the attempt. For this purpose I
gathered up my bow and arrows, which had laid in the bottom of the
canoe for some time, and which I did not intend to use any more,
but I wanted them as an excuse to get out and take such a start,
without being suspected, as would enable me to make good my escape.
We encamped on this river several days; waiting, I suppose, for
orders from the British. During this time I prepared myself for the
escape, but unfortunately for my design, the camp was on the wrong
side of the river, and I could not take a canoe without being
discovered, the camp being immediately on the bank of the stream.
In a few days we continued our journey. About this time I saw the
first bread since I had been taken prisoner. Some of the Indians
had been to the settlement and obtained about half a gallon of
flour; they prepared it in their homely way, but I thought it the
best bread that I had ever tasted.</p>
<p>On our way down the river, as we came to the road leading from
river Raisin to Detroit, we fell in with some Indians who had been
at Dudley's defeat. There was a young man with them, a prisoner;
the Indians told me by signs to talk with him. When I approached
and spoke to him, he seemed astonished, for he had taken me for an
Indian; but when he discovered my being an American he was greatly
rejoiced. He asked many questions about the Indians, and if I
thought that they would sell him. I told him I thought they would
not, as I had been their prisoner since the battle at Raisin, and
they had not offered to dispose of me. I farther told him I thought
his hopes of getting away soon, if ever, gloomy. He gave me a most
horrible account of the defeat of Colonel Dudley, and the slaughter
and massacre of his men&mdash;and expressed fears that General Harrison
would be taken. This was bitter news to me. While we were talking,
the Indians stood around and seemed to catch at every word, and
watch every expression of our faces&mdash;showing the greatest anxiety
to know what we said. They would laugh, and look at each other and
speak a word or two. It seemed to afford them pleasure to hear us
converse. But the time having arrived for us to proceed on our
journey, we parted&mdash;his company was going by land, and ours by
water, to Malden. If I heard the name of the young man I have
forgotten it. He was genteel and intelligent. He informed me that
he was a Surgeon. I never saw him again, and think it probable that
he was killed by the Indians&mdash;I am inclined to this opinion because
the Indians, we understood, brought in and offered for sale, that
spring, all which they did not intend to kill. I think if he had
been brought in I should have seen him. Some, it is highly
probable, were put to death in the room of those of their friends
who had fallen in battle.</p>
<p>We encamped at night, after we saw the young man named above, on
an island not far from Malden. The next day we arrived, and the
Indians took me down into the town, where I passed for an Indian.
It was very unpleasant to me to hear such swearing and profanity&mdash;
I soon left, and returned to the camp. In a few days we went up the
river to the neighborhood of Detroit, and pitched our tent near the
spring wells on the bank of Detroit river. Soon after our arrival
arrangements were made with the British Commissary to draw rations
of bread, and sometimes fish. They had the number of the family put
down in writing, which the Indians were to present before they
could draw the supply. The old Indian, having by some means
ascertained that I could write, fell upon a stratagem to increase
the quantity of bread. He furnished me with a slip of paper, and
proposed that we should alter the number of our family, and make it
larger; I did so, and made it about double. I went up with the note
myself the first time, to see how it would take. The Indians gave
me a horse and bag, and sent a young man of another family with me
as a guard, the distance being several miles. The young man
obtained his bread sooner than I did, and left me alone. I, after
so long a time, got my bread and started; as I passed through the
streets of Detroit, a lady spoke to me from an upper window, and
said: "Are you not a prisoner, sir?" "I am, madam." "Why do you not
leave the horse in the street and go to the fort then?" I told her
I was afraid; but did not say I lacked confidence in the British. I
feared they would not protect me, but deliver me up if the Indians
should demand me.</p>
<p>I went on toward home, and when I got in sight I discovered that
they had become uneasy, for the most of them were looking out
towards Detroit. When they saw me they raised a great yell, and
received me and my bag of bread with great joy.</p>
<p>Some time shortly after this the old man dressed himself up in
the finest kind of Indian style, for he was a Chief. He greased his
face, and then pounded and rubbed charcoal on it until he was as
black as a negro. He then painted my face red, and we started
together to town, he walking in front. As we passed along the
streets the people were very free in making their remarks upon us.
"There goes a mulato," said one, &amp;c., &amp;c. I seemed to pay
but little attention to what was said, but followed my old Indian
about from place to place.</p>
<p>In a few days they sent me over to <i>Sandwich</i>, to exchange skins
for boiled cider. I succeeded; and they drank it hot, that it might
produce the greater effect; their only design seeming to be to
produce intoxication. They are liberal with every thing they
possess but rum. I once saw an Indian give another a dram, and
being afraid that he would take too much, he first measured it in
his own mouth, and then put it into a tin cup for his friend to
drink.</p>
<p>Whilst we were here I saw Indians take medicine. I did not
ascertain what kind of medicine it was, only it was something which
they gathered from the woods. They boiled it down until it became
thick and black. They dug a hole in the ground&mdash;furnished
themselves with a kettle of warm water and a piece of inner
bark&mdash;after they took two or three portions of this stuff, they
laid down flat upon the ground, with their mouths over this hole,
and commenced vomiting. They would then drink large draughts of
warm water, thrust the piece of bark down their throats and vomit
again. This course they would sometimes pursue for hours together,
until one would think that they were almost dead; but they would
leave off this vomiting business and go about as though nothing had
disturbed them. I heard nothing of any sickness before this
medicinal course was commenced, from which I inferred that they
took medicine in the spring season whether sick or well.</p>
<p>Not far from our encampment was the grave of an Indian who had
been buried several weeks. An old squaw raised an alarm, saying
that he had been heard to make a noise. The Indians ran with all
haste to the grave&mdash;I went too to see what was to be done&mdash;but
although they listened with their ears upon the ground, and then
stamped with their feet, and scratched in the earth, the Indian lay
still and dead in his grave.</p>
<p>I learned from the preparations in camp that the squaws were
soon to go out to the Indian towns and raise corn, and that I was
to go with them. I resolved that I would not go, if my escape
should cost me my life. I began immediately to think and plan some
method of escape; but every way appeared to be hedged up; there
were Indian camps in every direction; there was some faint prospect
of success down the river. I also thought of risking myself in the
hands of the British, but, as I before said, I could not trust
them; and it was well for me that I did not, as I afterwards, to my
sore affliction, found them haughty and very inhuman to American
prisoners. I wish this censure to rest only upon the British
officers, as many of the soldiers would have treated us kindly if
it had been in their power.</p>
<p>Just at this crisis, however, an half Indian, who spoke English,
came to our camp. I took this opportunity of communicating to the
Indians my desire of being sold to the inhabitants of Detroit, who
were purchasing prisoners from the Indians, Here I run a great
risk&mdash;I knew not that they would not instantly kill me for making
such a request. No sooner had the half Indian told my wishes, than
every eye was fixed upon me; some seemed astonished, and others
angry, because I would think of leaving after having been adopted
into the family. They soon made signs that I might go, and the old
man began to look out for a purchaser. Some of them treated me
cooly from that time until I left. A Frenchman came to our camp,
and offered a young horse for me&mdash;we went several miles down the
river to see the horse&mdash;the Indian and Frenchman talked a long
time&mdash;the Frenchman showed several other horses&mdash;the Indian did not
fancy any of them, and there was no trade. I felt disappointed,
being very anxious to be swapped off. On the next day another
Frenchman came to camp riding a snug little pony, with mane and
tail roached and trimmed. This horse took the old man's eye, and
they soon closed the bargain. The long desired hour had come at
last. I felt that I was again free from the hand of the wild
savage. I packed up the few tattered rags of clothing which were
mine, and prepared to leave; but after all, savages as they were, I
was sorry when I bid them a final farewell. The wife of the man who
took me prisoner had always been kind&mdash;she aided greatly to lessen
my sufferings&mdash;she had often fed me, and when under the rigors of a
northern winter, in the wilderness, had thrown a blanket upon my
shivering frame at night; she had restrained the young men from
imposing upon me, as they would do by taking my food, and my place
at the fire. After Mr. J. B. Cecott, the man who bought me, and I
left the camp, the Indians stood and looked after us as long as
they could see us. Mr. Cecott took me to his own house, gave me a
suit of clothes, and introduced me to his family. Now I felt that
home was much nearer, being again among a civilized people who
could speak the English language.</p>
<p>And here let me pause a moment to remark&mdash;as I am about to leave
the Indians, never I hope to spend another winter with them under
the same circumstances&mdash;that the few months of captivity with this
people, were, taken altogether, the most cheerless and solitary of
any part of my life of which I have any recollection. Though many
years have rolled by since the events transpired, the impression
they made upon my mind is almost as fresh as ever.</p>
<p>Several things contributed to render the scene more gloomy. I
lost the day of the month, and also the day of the week; every day
seemed alike. No person can have an idea, unless they are placed in
the same predicament, how it changes the face of things to lose all
those divisions of time that we have been accustomed to observe
from our childhood. But this was not all; to render the hours more
tedious and solitary, there was not one, of all the families that
belonged to our company, that could either speak English, or
understand one word of it. And thus, day after day, and week after
week, passed over without uttering a solitary word, unless
sometimes, when a little distance from camp, I would say a word or
two just to hear the sound of my own voice; and it would seem so
strange to me, that it would almost startle me. And, in addition to
all this, I was almost eaten up by vermin; sometimes almost
starved; and shut out from all civilized society; almost literally
buried in the snows of Michigan; and in order to prevent actual
starvation, the Indians were compelled to remove from place to
place, where it was supposed the hunting would be better. This
subjected us to greater inconvenience, and often to great suffering
from cold, having to clear away the snow, which was very deep.</p>
<p>But the uncertainty, and the improbability, of being released,
being constantly upon me, and there appeared not the least gleam of
hope until it was announced, by the preparations I saw making in
the spring, to go to Detroit.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say against the Indian character&mdash;but many
things in favor of it&mdash;but much against their manner of life. They
are a brave, generous, hospitable, kind, and among themselves, an
honest people; and when they intend to save the life of a prisoner
they will do it, if it should be at the risk of their own. But
after all this is said, no one can form any adequate idea of what a
man <i>must</i> suffer, who spends a winter with them in the snows of
Michigan.</p>
<p>But now, that I was released by the friendly hand of a stranger,
Mr. Cecott, whom I shall recollect with feelings of gratitude so
long as I can recollect anything&mdash;I felt more than I shall ever be
able to express. Hope, which had almost perished, now began to
revive, and the sight of home and friends once more began to be
thought of as a matter not altogether impracticable&mdash;and that I
should set my foot again upon the happy soil of Kentucky.</p>
<p>But disappointment was at the door. Mr. Cecott informed me in a
few days that he would be compelled to give me up to the British as
a prisoner of war. I gave him my note for the horse which he gave
for me, which I paid him about eighteen months afterwards, when I
went out to war again, under General McArthur. I think the horse
was valued at thirty six dollars&mdash;you see what I was worth in
money. A number of prisoners were sold at Detroit from time to
time, and many of the citizens showed great liberality and humanity
in purchasing them. It should be spoken and recorded to their
praise, that some of the citizens spent nearly every thing which
they possessed in buying prisoners who had fallen into savage
hands, and in furnishing them with clothing and provision.</p>
<p>When I was delivered to the British as a prisoner of war, I was
placed in the guardhouse, where we remained all summer. During our
confinement we suffered from hunger, and what provisions we had
were not good. We had the floor for a bed, and a log for our
pillow, all the time. There were six or eight in the fort that had
been purchased before I was&mdash;they had were taken prisoners at
Dudley's defeat.</p>
This was a long tedious summer to me, for we had no employment
whatever, but were compelled to lay about the fort from the end of
one month to another. A gentleman in Detroit proposed to the
officer in command, to be surety for my appearance, if he would
permit me to go into the town and work at my trade, but he refused
to let me go upon any terms whatever.
<p>At times, during the summer, the streets of Detroit were filled
with Indians; and many of them came to see us. In the month of
July, we saw them have a young woman prisoner, whom we supposed
they had taken from the frontiers of Ohio. We could never learn
what disposition they made of her. A company of the Indians from
the northwest encamped for several days near the walls of the fort,
immediately previous to their going to war. This gave us an
opportunity of ascertaining their mode of preparation for war.
Among other things, they eat the flesh of dogs.</p>
<p>During our imprisonment here, we were brought to behold a very
shocking sight. We saw, in the hands of the Indians, a number of
scalps fastened in hoops made for the purpose and hung out before
the fire to dry. They had been but recently taken off: and more
horrible yet, the most of them were the scalps of females! We
remained for sometime upon the fort battery observing their
situation and employment before they saw us. When they beheld us,
and knew that we were prisoners, they raised the war-whoop
instantly in token of victory. They showed the tomahawk, and
pointed to the scalps, to tell that they had murdered the persons
with the tomahawk. They held up the scalp of a female and showed
signs of savage cruelty and barbarity, which I had never seen
exhibited before. These things were done in open day, in the
presence of the British officers; and those refined gentlemen, who
feel that they occupy a place of elevation and superior rank in
society, could look upon these shocking mockeries of humanity with
the hard heartedness of the savages themselves.</p>
<p>Many of the British soldiers were kind to us in our
imprisonment; they would steal us out by night, when the officers
were away carousing, that we might get some recreation and
refreshment. The officers were haughty and overbearing, doing
nothing for our comfort. The joy that I felt in being released from
the Indians, soon died amid my rough fare in the British prison.
During the summer we were almost entirely naked; and were only
saved from becoming completely so by the generosity of Mr. Hunt of
Detroit, who gave us each a suit of summer clothes; which was all
the clothing that we got until after we arrived at Quebec, sometime
in December. About the first of August, nearly all the soldiers and
Indians disappeared from Detroit. We were at a loss to account for
this, but supposed they had gone to make an attack upon some of the
forts, or frontier parts of the Northwestern Army. It was not a
great while until the secret was out. They came home cursing Major
Croghan, (they had made an unsuccessfull attack upon Lower
Sandusky,) and saying that he loaded his guns with nails, slugs,
and with any thing and every thing that came to hand. The faces of
some of them were completely peppered with small shot. They lost a
number of their best men in this battle. It is said that <i>Captain
James Hunter</i>, sometimes known by the name of "old Sandusky"&mdash;whom
Congress since presented with a sword as a token of national
respect&mdash;suspecting that the British and Indians would undertake to
storm the fort, right or wrong, swung up a long heavy log, which,
in case of extreme emergency, he intended to use as a <i>dead fall</i>
by cutting loose the ropes which held it upon the walls of the
fort. This Sandusky engagement appears to have been a hot business
all around.</p>
<p>The well known battle upon the lake, in which Perry was
successful, was fought during our confinement in this fort. We
heard the report of the guns plainly, and it produced much
excitement among all. Every eye was turned toward Malden, and we
eagerly caught every word that came from that direction.</p>
<p>A few days afterward they told us that the British had taken
Perry and all his fleet. The soldiers laughed at us, and told us
that the Yankees knew nothing about fighting on the water&mdash;that
they could whip us two to one. We had to bear this as well as we
could, until we saw great preparations making every where to remove
the arms, ammunition, &amp;c., which were sent up the river. We now
suspected that they had misinformed us of the result of the battle.
When we asked, they told us one thing and then another, until one
of the soldiers privately told us the whole tale&mdash;that Perry had
actually captured the British fleet&mdash;and that the Yankees were
coming upon us in great numbers, and were just at hand. We now
turned the tables upon them&mdash;it was our time to be merry.</p>
<p>Every day increased the hurry and confusion; boats and small
vessels were ascending the river Detroit, bearing off arms,
provisions, and every species of property, belonging to the
British. It was a time of joy to the citizens of Detroit,
generally, to see the Indians and British leaving so rapidly: and
we were looking almost hourly to behold the Kentuckians appear in
sight. We were, however, hurried up the river, as there was no
opportunity to escape. The Indians were always kept in the rear
during a retreat, and stood between the British and danger. If I
had kept the day of the month, I could tell where Harrison, Shelby,
and Johnson, were at the time when we left Detroit. Not knowing the
position of the American army, it was fruitless to hazard an effort
to escape.</p>
<p>Our British masters crowded us into a vessel which was loaded
with arms and ammunition, without provisions or any arrangements
for our comfort on the way. As we ascended the lake, we ran aground
near the mouth of the river Thames, and were detained two days;
during which time we were compelled to unload and reload the
vessel. All this time we had nothing to eat but what we could pick
up, like dogs, from the offal of the ship. Here I was tempted, and
worse yet, yielded to the temptation, to steal something to eat,
and risk consequences. The British officer had some beef hung out
on the stern of the vessel, I took some of it, and we eat it. The
meat was tainted; yet it was sweet to us, not because it was
stolen, but because we were starving.</p>
<p>After we had succeeded in getting the vessel over the sandbar,
the wind was unfavorable, and the British officer determined to
abandon her, and (after getting her up near Dalton's she was burned
to prevent the Americans from making any spoils,) here we were put
on shore, and walked, hungry and faint, fifteen miles to Dalton's,
where we were guarded closely. This was only the beginning of hard
times. We discovered the determination of the British to send us
down through Canada, and consequently began to lose all hope of
seeing the American army. A guard of British and Indians was
prepared to take us on. A cart load of provision was started with
us, but we never saw it after the morning on which we left
Dalton's. Why this provision was started, and not suffered to
proceed, we never could even guess. The officer was very rigorous,
and would not suffer us to stop and procure any refreshment, but
drove us onward like cattle going to market. The second night after
we left <i>Dalton's</i>, we encamped in the woods. They now kept a close
watch over us&mdash;and we were as eagerly looking for an opportunity to
escape. Had we forseen the sufferings that were ahead, we should,
at least some us, have made the attempt to escape at every hazard.
As stated above, our provisions were left behind, and we were under
the dominion of an unfeeling wretch, who would but very seldom even
suffer us to go into a house to ask for a morsel of bread. He would
march us hard all day, and at night put us into a barn or stable to
sleep. We often travelled in the rain, and then laid down without
fire in our wet clothes to try and rest. This journey of about five
hundred miles by land, and four hundred by water, we travelled, in
that cold and rainy country, with our thin gingham clothes, given
to us by Mr. Hunt of Detroit: some of us were without shoes and
coats; and we lived upon potatoes and turnips just as we could pick
them up as we passed by farms.</p>
<p>This part of the journey, from Dalton's to Burlington Heights,
was, perhaps, the most painful of any; not being permitted whilst
at Detroit to take much exercise, and being forced on almost beyond
our strength, rendered it painful beyond expression. And that was
not all: the officer of the guard, being a churlish and tyranical
man by nature, failed not to make use of the little brief power
committed to him for the occasion, to make our sufferings the more
insupportable. It seemed to afford him a pleasure to "add
affliction to our bonds." On some occasions, after travelling hard
all day in the rain, and having no other lodging but a barn or
stable, we had some difficulty in getting fire enough, or getting
admittance to it, sufficient to dry our clothes. On this part of
the journey, in addition to suffering from the cold rains, and from
being compelled to lie down in our wet clothes, we were almost
literally starved. On leaving the vessel on the Thames, I found a
canister which had been emptied of the shot; this I took with me,
which served to cook our potatoes, turnips, and peas, when we could
get them, and when our cruel commander would give us time for it;
but to add still more to our inconvenience, one of the Indian
guard, on returning from Burlington Heights, stole even that from
me. This was done by stratagem, (and, by-the-by, the Indians are
not slow at it.) As some of them had to return from that place, and
were preparing for the journey, one of the party come to me and
asked the loan of my cooking vessel. I very readily loaned it to
him, not suspecting any design; but finding him rather tardy, I
made application for it: he gave me to understand that he was not
done with it; and being compelled to march immediately, I had to
leave it behind. We sometimes had pickeled pork, which I generally
eat raw. The people in that country raised peas, which they mowed
and put away vines and all together for their cattle. We would,
when lodging in barns and stables, make beds of these, and shell
out and eat the peas, and also take some along with us to eat by
the way.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to notice all the particulars of this
painful march, from the Thames to York, and from York to Kingston.
It was almost an uninterrupted scene of suffering from the
beginning to the end. The officer of the guard seemed unwilling to
show any kindness himself, or that any one else should show us any.
The remembrance of these things, though twenty six years have
rolled between, produces a kind of horror in my soul even at this
hour. Here is the way that a company of ragged, naked, and starved,
Kentucky boys were driven through the country to be gazed upon and
laughed at by the inhabitants of the villages and towns through
which we passed.</p>
<p>When we reached York, we were closely confined in jail until
another guard was appointed to take us on to Kingston. This was one
of the most filthy prisons that I ever saw. Here they had a
difficulty in obtaining a new guard: the one which brought us to
this place from the river Thames consisted chiefly of Indians, and
as they were not willing to proceed any farther, the officer had to
look for some of the most vigilant soldiers to take their place. We
found all along that they were not willing to risk us with a guard
of British soldiers until we arrived at this point, when they
supposed there would be less danger of an escape.</p>
<p>We tarried several days at York, and then took the road to
Kingston; and the farther we went the worse the travelling became,
the weather colder, and our clothing more ragged, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I must not omit to mention a widow lady who resided between York
and Kingston. She took all the prisoners into her house, treated
them kindly, supplied all their wants, and in every respect showed
a kind and feeling heart. If I ever knew her name, I have forgotten
it: I should like to record it here.</p>
<p>When we came to Kingston we were again put in a filthy jail. It
was now about the first of November, and we were allowed very
little fire, and our clothing so thin, that we had to shiver it out
the best way we could. Our spirits remained unsubdued, and we felt
cordially to despise that tyranny which heaped suffering upon us.
We rejoiced that it was in defence of dear liberty that these
afflictions had fallen upon us; and we hoped by some means soon to
enjoy our liberty again.</p>
<p>The British troops at this place were in regular drilling. The
infantry and artillery were daily employed in firing at targets. My
attention was specially drawn to their manner of shooting at a
target, made of an empty barrel placed out in the lake. This was
done that they might, with the greater certainty, fire upon a
vessel as it approached the town. We supposed that they were in
expectation of an attack from the Yankee fleet upon lake Ontario.
From Kingston we started to Montreal in open boats; if possible
this was yet worse than travelling by land, for we could take no
exercise to keep ourselves warm. The rains that fell upon us now,
appeared as cold as during any part of winter in Kentucky, and we
were still in our thin clothing. The boat was scarcely large enough
to contain the seventeen prisoners, and the guard; and not high
enough for us to stand up; so we had to sit down on the bottom of
the boat, and endure the cold from morning until night. I think we
slept but once in a house between Kingston and Montreal, and that
was the upper room of an unfinished court house, where we had a
small stove, and where we dried our few rags of clothing. At length
we came in sight of Montreal; they landed us above the town that
they might march us through the city, to be seen as a rare
curiosity. Word had reached the town before us, that a number of
Kentucky prisoners were to pass through that day; and it appeared
that the whole city had collected into that street to see the great
sight. The windows and doors were full of ladies, manifesting great
eagerness to see Kentuckians. The reader may perhaps imagine my
feelings at this time, for I shall not attempt to describe
them.</p>
<p>We were now taken to jail as usual, where we were furnished with
a good room, and for the first time since we left Detroit our
situation was somewhat comfortable. I think we remained here near
two weeks. Our old rags of clothes, which were given us by the
British soldiers, proved rather an annoyance to us, as the jail was
warm and the vermin began to multiply in great numbers. We had no
change of raiment, consequently we had no washing done; thus we
spent the time at Montreal.</p>
<p>As before remarked, the vermin became very annoying&mdash;and having
no possible chance of avoiding them, I fell upon the plan of
turning my clothes every morning, so as to keep them
travelling.</p>
<p>In order to form an adequate idea of these tormenters of the
human family, you must be shut up in a hot, filthy prison, with a
number of prisoners clothed in filthy rags, and yourself as bad as
any of them, with thousands and millions of these bosom friends
crawling over you. If that would not make an impression, I don't
know what would.</p>
<p>A right regular built Yankee, who had been but recently taken
upon the lines not far from Montreal, was brought into the prison a
few days previous to our leaving for Quebec. He was discovered,
shortly after his arrival, to pick one of those troublers of our
peace from his white shirt, and very deliberately lay him down on a
bench, after which, taking a small chip between his finger and
thumb, succeeded in dispatching him. This manouvre afforded some
sport for some of us who had learned, by things we had suffered,
not to take it quite so tedious. He was told that he would soon
learn to kill them without a chip.</p>
<p>At this place we were told by the British that we were eating
Yankee beef&mdash;that most of their supplies came from the States. As
it is not my business, I will forbear censuring; and will content
myself with barely stating facts. These things occur very
frequently all along the line between Canada and the United States
in time of war; and men who profess great patriotism are sometimes
found to be engaged in it. Such patriotism as this would scarcely
be found in Kentucky.</p>
<p>We left for Quebec in a steam boat, the first built on the St.
Lawrence, and arrived there in about twenty four hours. The jail
here was less comfortable than the one at Montreal. We were
literally in rags, and remained so for many weeks; we had an agent
whose duty it was to see that we were provided for, but if my
memory serves me, he did not so much as visit the prison for nearly
three weeks, and then we were treated by him like so many
slaves.</p>
<p>After so long a time, Gardner, the agent, furnished each of us
with a suit of coarse clothing. By this time the weather had become
excessively cold, and we were removed to the barracks until a
prison could be prepared for us upon cape Diamond, where we
principally spent the time whilst we remained at Quebec.</p>
<p>After we removed to cape Diamond our number was greatly
increased. Only seventeen Kentuckians came down together from
Detroit; but there were many others taken at different times and
places; some sailors, but mostly they were regular soldiers. These
had been confined in other parts of the jail, and now, when
collected together, we numbered say ninety, all put into one house
together. Here we had a small yard where we could take some
exercise; this was a great privilege to men who had been so long in
close confinement. We were closely locked up at night, and
generally under a strict guard. The windows were strongly grated,
and we had only light from one side. Our provisions were scanty and
bad; I suffered more from hunger in Quebec than during any time of
my long imprisonment. It was not because they had no provisions,
but because they chose to starve us. When we were in Montreal they
tauntingly told us that we were eating Yankee beef&mdash;giving us to
understand that they were furnished with provisions from the United
States. This scantiness of supply continued through the winter, and
we were under the necessity of enduring our sufferings as we could.
We were told that British prisoners in the United States fared
worse than we did. Our wood was birch, and it served a double
purpose; for we burned the wood, and made tea of the bark&mdash;this was
all the tea or coffee which we drank in the city of Quebec.</p>
<p>The agent allowed us to draw each a few dollars in money; with
this we bought articles from those who visited our prison. We were
not very economical with our money; it lasted but a short time.</p>
<p>Some of the prisoners were always forming plans of escape, but
could never mature them. At one time we were well nigh an
elopement, but one proved a traitor, and informed the British
officer of the design. The traitor had been in the regular service,
and was taken a prisoner somewhere between Canada and the United
States. Some offers were made to him, and he meanly enlisted as a
British soldier, and divulged every thing which he supposed would
make our condition more miserable. He told of the contemplated
escape, and who were the most active as the leaders. On the next
day the keeper of the prison came up, and upon examination finding
that the account was true, and ascertaining who had cut the holes,
he sent the poor fellows to the dungeon, where they were doomed to
remain for two weeks upon half rations. After this pennance they
were permitted to return to their former place. This broke up all
designs of escape, as we were closely watched during the remainder
of our stay.</p>
<p>After the fellow above named enlisted, strong efforts were made
to induce others to follow his example. In order to this, they sent
one of the officers who had command of the guard that brought us
from York to Kingston, supposing that because we were acquainted
with him, he would therefore have more influence with us. He was,
however, the last man that should have been sent; we knew him to be
sure, but we knew him to be a hard hearted tyrant, who had starved
and drove us nearly to death. We were displeased at seeing him come
into the prison, and no sooner had he made known his errand, than
we gave him to understand flatly and plainly that deserters were
not to be found among us. We expressed our detestation at the
conduct of the one who had turned tory and traitor, and told him if
there was no other way of a release from prison, that we would
greatly prefer to lie in the fort until we were starved and
perished to death. We moreover gave him to understand that we would
not be insulted in that manner, and that he would do well to leave
the fort&mdash;and some of the boys went so far as to take their tin
pans, and beating upon them with their spoons, actually drummed him
out of the prison. By this experiment they were fully satisfied
that it was a most fruitless business to try to induce us to leave
our happy government and join theirs. It was often reported that we
would be sent to Dartmoor prison, in England, and there kept as
hostages, until the differences between the two governments should
be adjusted. We sometimes thought perhaps it might be so, but we
scarcely believed anything which they told us; their object no
doubt was to alarm, with the fear of crossing the Atlantic, that
they might the more easily pursuade us to desert. Although this
thing bore a very gloomy aspect, and was often a subject of serious
conversation among us, yet we were determined, and strengthened
each other in the purpose, not to desert, but to endure the worst,
and be true to our country.</p>
<p>About this time we learned that Tecumseh, the great Indian
warrior, had fallen in the battle at Moravian town. His family was
at this time in Quebec; they, in company with some other Indians,
came to see us, and manifested great curiosity in taking a good
look at Kentuckians&mdash;considered by some the rarest beings upon the
earth.</p>
<p>Often numbers of people came to the prison to see us&mdash;one man,
after looking at us for a length of time, manifested great
disappointment, and said, "Why, they look just like other people."
It seemed from this that an idea prevailed that we were wild men,
or an order of beings that scarcely belonged to this earth.</p>
<p>During the time that we remained here Colonel Lewis and Major
Madison visited us. Of the latter, the Vice President of the United
States lately said in the Senate, that he was a man "of rare
patriotism&mdash;the most beloved of all the public men of his
State&mdash;the best among the best&mdash;'the bravest of the brave'&mdash;who
died with never fading laurels upon his brow." They were
accompanied by one or two British officers. After they had duly
examined into our situation, Colonel Lewis encouraged us to bear
our privations and sufferings in the spirit of true soldiers&mdash;
saying "that it belonged to the soil of Kentucky to be firm." While
this exhortation of the Colonel was received by us with great
approbation, it evidently was received with indignation by the
British officers. This made no manner of difference with Colonel
Lewis, who proceeded to make such remarks, and gave us such advice,
as he believed were for our comfort. I thought that the British
were inclined to press their rigid military rules upon Kentuckians
with more rigor than upon others. They rarely spoke to us, and when
they did it was in a manner so haughty that we only felt the more
indignant and hostile toward them. We would not conform to those
terms of respect which they exacted from their own soldiers. Our
feelings, and callings in life had been so very different from
those of British soldiers, that we felt as if we lived in, and
breathed, a different air.</p>
<p>Toward the latter part of the winter we were, after much
entreaty from Lewis and Madison, permitted to write to our friends.
Our letters were carefully read by the officers, and every word
rigidly examined. I now wrote to my friends, and this was the first
certain information that they received of my having survived the
battles and dangers which we had passed through, although I had now
been away from home about eighteen months. Notices had been in the
public prints, written by Hunt, of Detroit, that prisoners had been
carried on towards Quebec&mdash;but he had no further knowledge of us,
or what would be our fate.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was better that we were not permitted to give a
history of our sufferings: it would only have more deeply afflicted
our friends, and added nothing to our relief.</p>
<p>I wish here to record, that the news of our unsuccessful attempt
to escape reached, by some means, the ears of Colonel Lewis and
Major Madison, and they being desirous to obtain the particulars,
requested that two of our number might be allowed to visit their
quarters, which were not far off. Their request was granted, and
William McMillan and myself were selected to visit them. We were
conducted by a guard, and very closely watched and listened to. We
told them of our attempt and defeat. They gave it as their opinion
that we could not make a successful escape during the winter
season, and that we ought not to attempt it. They told us of the
great difficulty we would meet in travelling through the snow in
that country, also in crossing the river St. Lawrence, even if we
could, undiscovered, pass the guards. However, in case we should
make the attempt, they gave us some directions touching the route
that we should take if we succeeded in clearing the sentinels and
crossing the river.</p>
<p>While writing this, I am reminded of an attempt made by some
prisoners to escape about the time that we came to Quebec. They cut
the bars out of the prison windows of the second story of the
house, and let themselves down by means of their blankets. They
were successful in passing the sentinels, and crossing the river,
and prospered all the way until they came near the American lines.
Now, thinking that they were out of the reach of danger, they
halted to take rest and refreshment, and feeling like birds let out
of a cage, they felt that they might safely have a little spree;
but just as they were in the midst of their frolic, the British
pursuers came suddenly upon them, and took them all by surprise.
They were not prepared to defend themselves, and had no opportunity
to fly; therefore they had quietly to go back to Quebec, and to
prison, where they suffered the deep mortification of a failure,
and the renewed weight of British oppression.</p>
<p>Some time before we heard the good news of a general exchange of
prisoners, I had a violent attack of billious fever. I laid several
days in the prison before I suffered the old turnkey to know my
situation. When it was communicated to him, he sent an old man to
bleed me and to give me some physic, which gave me no relief; I was
therefore removed about a mile from town, to the hospital, where
they bled and physiced me enough. I do not recollect how long I
remained at the hospital, but I remember that I was there when it
was announced that all prisoners were to be exchanged, and that all
who were able to go were to be sent away immediately. This was
better to me than all the medicine in Canada. The hope of seeing my
country and my home, rushed in upon my mind with refreshing power.
I told the Doctor that I could not stay any longer in the
hospital&mdash;that I must start if I died on the way. At first he
opposed my going; seeing my resolution, at length he consented. The
idea of being kept behind was like death to me sure enough. For
some days before this news reached us I had been slowly recovering,
but was yet barely able to walk when I left the hospital to return
to the prison, where I found the boys making preparations to leave
for the United States. We were to ascend the St. Lawrence in a
vessel belonging to the British. It was in the month of May when we
left this gloomy prison, where we had spent a miserable winter and
spring. The recollection of these times are horrible to my mind
until this hour. I am sorry that I ever fell into British hands. It
appears that the British officers were perfectly destitute of human
feelings, so far as we were concerned. I have no means of knowing
generally their characters, and I surely have no wish to defame
them generally; I speak only of those into whose hands I fell, and
from whom I received such little kindness.</p>
<p>May had not brought warm weather in that country; heaps of
drifted snow were to be seen in the mountains north of Quebec; and
the northwestern winds were keen and chilling, especially to me in
my feeble state. After we boarded our little vessel, we remained
several days, I know not what for, in an uncomfortable situation;
with but little fire, and exposed to the incessantly blowing winds.
This increased again the disease under which I had been laboring,
so that I now had chill and fever every day. I was barely able to
walk, and more than one thousand miles from home, without money,
clothes, or friends that were able to help; yet my spirit did not
quail for a moment,&mdash;I hoped somehow to get through. At length we
were put into another vessel, and set sail up the St. Lawrence.
Thus we continued until we came to the mouth of the river Sorrell,
which connects lake Champlain with the St. Lawrence. We ascended
this river for a considerable distance in the same vessel, when we
were placed in open boats and carried across the line. It was said,
with what truth I pretend not to say, that some of the British
soldiers who guarded us made a good use of this opportunity and
deserted, and left a land of oppression for a land of liberty and
plenty.</p>
<p>We were set on the shore fourteen miles below Plattsburg, and
then left to take care of ourselves, having neither money nor food,
and almost naked, and some of us sick. We however, used to trials,
went forward to Plattsburg&mdash;which I reached with the utmost
difficulty, shaking one part of the day, and burning with fever the
other. We had all been so long in confinement that we travelled
slowly, and this enabled me to keep up until we arrived at a large
encampment of the American army, a short distance above Plattsburg
on the lake.</p>
Our situation was communicated to the General, who promised to make
provision for us, by giving us written passports, and authorizing
us to draw rations on the road wherever we could find any belonging
to the United States&mdash;which was all that we could expect, or all
that we asked, as he had no authority to pay us money. We waited a
day or two for the fulfilment of this promise, when we renewed our
application, telling him our necessities, how long we had been from
home, where we had been taken prisoners, our anxiety to pursue our
journey&mdash;but all to no effect; we only obtained promises. Having
renewed our petitions for a week, we began to despair of success,
and thought of seeking help from some other quarter. We were now
satisfied that it was the purpose of the commanding officer to
detain us there, place difficulties in our way of going home, that
thereby we might be induced to enlist; he supposed that we would
not certainly undertake such a journey on foot, without money or
passports. This did alarm one or two of the company, who took the
bounty and enlisted for five years. The rest of us now resolved to
make a start towards old Kentucky; but before we left we made one
more unsuccessful effort to obtain the necessary papers from the
General. By this time a kind and noble hearted young Lieutenant,
whose name was Frederick, became interested in our welfare, and
wrote us a passport to draw upon any supplies belonging to the
Government. This answered a good purpose where the keepers were
young and ignorant, and did not understand their business; but our
order was often protested.
<p>Notwithstanding my fatigue and exposure to the night air, and a
chill every day, my strength had much increased, yet I feared the
fatigues of the long journey before us; but to my astonishment I
had the last chill on the evening before we left the encampment&mdash;I
never had another.</p>
<p>On a beautiful morning, about the first of June, 1814, we left
the American army near Plattsburg, turning our faces towards home
with light hearts and little money. I had but twelve and a half
cents, and I believe I was nearly as wealthy as any of the company.
And now I feel utterly at a loss to describe my feelings. Until now
we did not feel entirely free; though in the American camp, we were
under sentinels and military restraint. We had been for so long a
time in prison, and suffering, that we seemed to have reached a new
world almost. We little thought of the journey that was before us,
but talked cheerfully of our situation, as we passed many beautiful
farms in high promise, situated upon the sides of the lake. Above
all, we felt hearts of sincere gratitude to a kind Providence, who
had delivered us out of the hands of wild and ferocious savages,
and hard hearted tyrants, and had again brought our feet to stand
upon the soil of freedom.</p>
<p>We made our way up the lake on the right bank until we came to
the ferry, which we found some difficulty in crossing, because we
had no money to pay our passage. We told the keeper the true story
of our errand&mdash;where we had been, and where we were going: after
some hesitancy he took us all over without any pay. We then took
the road leading to the head of lake Champlain; some of the people
along this road were kind, but others looked upon us with
suspicion. Our appearance was very shabby indeed&mdash;the coarse
clothes which we received in Quebec, the winter past, were all in
rags and dirt, and having no possible opportunity of getting a new
supply, we were compelled to appear before all in our way in this
garb. Our rags may have been an advantage to us, as they attracted
notice, and curiosity would induce many to ask us questions, and
thus we would have an opportunity of telling our history, and so
gain something to sustain us upon our journey. This afforded us a
good opportunity of ascertaining the dispositions of men. Many were
suitably affected with our situation, and offered relief; but other
cold blooded animals had no compassion&mdash;they lived within and for
themselves&mdash;and we found some so destitute of all sense of respect
as even to insult us.</p>
<p>After travelling together a short distance, we began to find
that it would be with difficulty that we could travel through that
country without money. We consulted together what way would be the
best for us to take, and concluded to separate, as beggars had
better go in small companies. When we parted, it was with the
understanding that we would try to meet again at Oleann Point, on
the Alleghany river. Thus we bid each other farewell, and broke off
into companies of four. The company to which I belonged took the
road leading from the head of the lake to Utica, in the State of
New York. This road was mostly turnpiked, which made the travelling
worse for us, as we were nearly barefooted, and our feet soon
became sore, so that our stages were short. It would be impossible
for me to relate the particulars of this journey through the State
of New York; but one thing truth compels me to state, and that is,
we suffered more from hunger while passing through this State than
in all the rest of the way from Quebec to Kentucky. We found the
people generally either too proud or too stingy to give us food, or
to treat us like human beings. In passing through the little towns
and villages our appearance would immediately attract attention,
and in a few minutes the people would gather around us in great
numbers; they would ask us a number of questions, which we would
fully answer, though they often suspected us for being deserters.
We occasionally found in these companies, persons who were touched
by our appearance and story, so they would turn out and raise a few
shillings to help us on our journey. The money thus raised we
considered as common property, to be used for the benefit of all.
We made it last as long as possible, by always purchasing the
cheapest articles of food, and never spending any
unnecessarily.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Utica we found a recruiting party there; and
here I picked up a pair of old shoes which had been thrown away by
the soldiers; these enabled me to travel on the turnpike with more
ease and speed. We found but few who were willing either to feed or
lodge us without pay, though we only asked to lie upon the floor.
Some absolutely refused to give us any shelter at all. I will here
relate a case, and if I knew the name of the individual I would
record it as a Warning to any one who might be tempted to treat any
poor sufferer in like manner. After travelling hard all the day, we
called at a house and asked the man the favor to stay and lie upon
the floor until morning, at the same time informing him that we had
been prisoners for some time, and that we were on our way to
Kentucky, our native State, and that we would not ask him for any
thing else. He told us pointedly that we could not sleep in his
house. We then asked to sleep in the shop, (he was a wagon maker:)
this he also refused; we then told him that we were much fatigued,
and would be glad to have permission to lie down in his barn. He
then refused in the most positive manner; telling us that there was
a tavern about a mile ahead, and as they had the profit of
travellers, they should have the trouble also. We left him to his
conscience, and walked on toward the tavern, feeling that we were
strangers indeed in a strange land, driven from door to door,
fatigued and hungry, without one cent in our pockets, knowing not
where we should find shelter; and returning too from fighting the
battles of the country we were now passing through so poorly
requited. At length we came to the tavern, and by stating our
misfortunes we succeeded in gaining permission to sleep on the
floor. Soon after our arrival supper was announced, but nothing was
said to us. We laid down on the floor of the bar room hungry, tired
and sleepy. If we had received such treatment in an enemy's
country, we would not have been surprised, but we had been out
fighting for the liberties of this very people&mdash;this made our
sufferings the more acute. We made an early start next morning,
supposing that the chance for breakfast would be as gloomy as that
of the supper had been. We determined to go forward as far as
possible, hoping soon to find another kind of people, who would
help us.</p>
<p>When we applied in the evening for permission to lie in the
barn, and were refused, there was a gentleman present who overtook
us a day or two afterwards, and reminded us of the treatment, and
that he was present; he gave each of us some money&mdash;he said that he
had no money when he first saw us.</p>
<p>Not far from this hard place, we met a man of quite a different
feeling. Near sunset we were passing his house, when he called to
us and asked if we had any money; we told him we had none: "Well,
you had better stop here with me and stay all night, for the man
who keeps the next house is a tory, and will not permit you to stay
without money." I need hardly say that we acceeded to his
proposition. We were treated with kindness and hospitality, and for
once fared well. This was a set-off to some former cases.</p>
<p>After we had passed through the thickly settled parts of New
York, we came to the Gennessee country, which was at that time but
thinly inhabited. We were now told that we would find serious
difficulties in passing on without money; on the day that we
entered what was called the wilderness we were entirely destitute,
and had very serious fears of suffering more than we had yet been
called to endure; but as our fears were rising to the highest
pitch, we unexpectedly met a young officer belonging to the United
States service; he inquired into our history carefully, and
becoming satisfied with the account which we gave him of our
capture and sufferings, he kindly gave us one dollar a piece, which
was sufficient, with rigid economy, to carry us through the most
dreaded part of the wilderness.</p>
<p>It may appear to the reader that I have given, a very cheerless
and rigid account of the people along the road that we traveled
through the State of New York; I am certain of the truth of the
history, for a man starving knows when he receives any thing to
eat, and also when he is refused. I am as certain of this part of
the history, as that I was in the battle, and wounded at the river
Raisin. Whether we fell upon the only niggardly people that lived
in that part of the country, or whether the people were mostly
tories there, I have no means of determining. It may be asked why I
record these things? It may seem harsh to speak of them; it was
much harsher to feel them. If people will sin publicly, and drive
starving begging soldiers from their doors with contempt, those
soldiers, if they should live to reach home, and should write an
account of their trip, will be very likely to refer to such
treatment. If those folks are yet living, a sermon upon "be careful
to entertain <i>strangers</i>," might not be entirely without its good
effects upon them.</p>
<p>After passing through this wilderness, we began to draw near to
Oleann Point, the place where we had agreed to meet again when we
parted at the head of lake Champlain. One company overtook us on
the same day that we arrived at Oleann. Here we had intended to
take water, but we could hear of no craft going down the river. Our
money was gone, and provisions were scarce and dear, so we could
not stay long here. Necessity, the mother of invention, drove us to
seek out some way of getting on. We numbered eight persons at this
time; I remember the names of <i>Philip Burns, Patrick Ewing, Simon
Kenton, Thomas Bronaugh, William McMillan</i> and <i>Thomas
Whittington</i>. At length we concluded to build a raft of slabs that
we found lodged against a bridge; so we all went to work; having
walked so far, our wind was pretty good, and got our raft completed
by sunset&mdash;on Sunday too. We then procured some bread, and set sail
down the river a little before dark, not knowing what was before
us, whether there were dangerous passes, or falls in the
river&mdash;such was our destitute situation, that we were compelled to
go on. Our provisions were nearly out, and Indians chiefly
inhabited the country along the river down towards Pittsburg.
During the night we had some difficulty in passing the drift at the
short bends that are in the Alleghany, but went on tolerably well
until next morning about breakfast time. I had laid myself down
upon the dry part of the raft and fallen asleep, not having slept
any during the night, as there was not room for more than two or
three to lie down at once. We now came in contact with a driftwood,
and the current was so strong that the raft was taken under almost
instantly&mdash;we scrambled up on the drift, and after some difficulty
got ashore. The raft came out below, and went on; and then we were
left on foot again, among the Indians called Corn Planters.
Fortunately for us, we had taken a Yankee passenger aboard our
raft, who had some money with him, with which we bought a canoe
from an Indian in which we came down the river until we reached
Pittsburg. Before we reached Pittsburg we met a recruiting party at
the mouth of French creek; the officer was very kind&mdash;he furnished
us with a room to sleep in&mdash;gave us flour and whiskey. His object
was to enlist some of us; we did not tell him that we would not
enlist; we sat up however and baked bread enough whilst the others
were asleep to last us to Pittsburg; and before the officer was out
of his bed in the morning, we were paddling on towards home.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Pittsburg, we sold the canoe for five
dollars, and purchased bread, and almost immediately took passage
on a salt boat bound for Kanawha. But whilst we were in Pittsburg
we there saw the British soldiers that guarded us at Detroit
prison&mdash;they had been taken at the battle of the Thames&mdash;they were
at liberty to go to any part of the town, and to work for
themselves. We took this opportunity to remind them of the
difference between their treatment of us, and our treatment toward
them; they were compelled to acknowledge the truth, and praised our
officers very highly.</p>
<p>We paid our passage upon the salt boat, by working at the oars,
all except myself, who was the cook for the company. When we
floated down as far as Kanawha we were there set upon the shore,
and were once more compelled to look about for the means of
continuing our journey. After we had been there a few hours we saw
a raft of pine plank floating down the river; we hailed the owner,
asked for a passage, and were taken aboard. On this raft I floated
down to Maysville, where, thanks to a superintending Providence, I
once again set my feet upon Kentucky soil, and breathed the air of
my native State. Now I was almost naked; no person, as well as I
can remember, had offered me a single article of clothing since I
left Quebec. I had exchanged my pantaloons, given to me in prison,
for an old pair which I found on the boat, thrown away as useless
by some of the boatmen; my shirt had, by slow degrees, entirely
disappeared; I had some where picked up an old coat that had been
the property of some regular soldier&mdash;these two articles
constituted my wardrobe, entire&mdash;I was barefooted, but had an old
hat.</p>
<p>My companions had all left me higher up the river, and gone
across the country as a nearer way home. When I left the raft and
went into the town my situation excited attention, and soon all my
wants were supplied. Some gave the stuff, and a number of tailors
joined, and in a few hours I was clothed, and furnished with money
to bear my expenses home. I felt the difference here between warm
and cold hearted people. My anxiety was great to pursue my journey,
so I ascended the steep hill that hangs around Maysville, and made
my way through Georgetown and Frankfort, to Shelbyville, at which
place I arrived on the 20th day of June, A. D. 1814.</p>
<p>Here, at length, after an absence of nearly two years, during
all of which time I had been exposed to sufferings, dangers and
privations, not having slept upon a bed until my return to my
native land, I found myself among the friends of my childhood and
my own beloved kindred. I had left them, when a mere lad, as a
volunteer soldier in the company commanded by Captain Simpson, and
I came back to them a man in years, though feeble in strength and
frail in appearance. The meeting indeed was unexpected to them, and
none can tell the fullness of joy that reigned in my own heart.</p>
<p>A kind and merciful Providence had preserved and sustained me
through all the perils with which I was surrounded, and unto Him do
I give the praise for my safety. Many years have passed since the
occurrences detailed in this narrative took place. I may now almost
be classed in the number of old men. My avocations have been those
of peace. I have, for nearly twenty years, as an ordained Minister
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, endeavored to teach the mild
doctrines of my blessed master. Yet it may not be without its use
to my young countrymen to know what their fathers have suffered. I
have told them a plain unvarnished tale, which while it may
encourage them to be bold in their country's cause, may also,
acquaint them with what they owe to the generation that has just
preceded them.</p>

<p>Note.&mdash;On pages 29 and 30 of the foregoing narrative, mention is
made of the reception, by the suffering volunteers, of a seasonable
supply of clothes that had been made up and sent to the army by the
patriotic ladies of Kentucky. I have, since the commencement of
this publication, met with an article that appeared in the
Frankfort Commonwealth (when that paper was under the editorial
direction of Orlando Brown, Esq.) entitled "Kentucky Mothers," in
which allusion is made to the same transaction. I have thought it
not irrelevant to append it to this, as it shows, in a striking
manner, the deep devotion to country felt by the ladies of
Kentucky, and the extent of the sacrifices they were prepared to
make. Although Mr. Brown did not give the name of this noble
mother, I have his permission to state that the lady alluded to is
the venerable Mrs. Elizabeth Love, who yet resides in Frankfort,
beloved by all for her eminent worth, and characterized by high
intellectual endowments associated with fervent piety, unaffected
charity, and every trait that dignifies and adorns the female
sex.</p>

<h3>KENTUCKY MOTHERS.</h3>
<p>"The deep interest which passing events are giving to the
history of the campaigns of the North-Western Army, naturally sets
the memory to work in recalling the incidents that gave them their
peculiar character. The achievments of the volunteers under the
gallant Harrison, are written in the brightest pages of the records
of their country, and must live so long as the human heart thrills
at the contemplation of deeds of lofty heroism. But Kentucky does
not point solely to her brave soldiers, and challenge admiration
for them. Far, far from it; for to the noble mothers and daughters
of our State belongs a chaplet of unfading laurels. <i>They</i> espoused
the cause of their country with an ardour never surpassed in any
land under the sun. Company after company, batallion after
batallion, left the State for the scene of war, and although the
bloodiest battles were fought, and men came home with thinned ranks
and wearied frames, and the wail of the widow and the orphan was
loud in the lament for the slain, the fire of patriotism burnt the
brighter, and the women of Kentucky, never faltering, still urged
on the men to battle. Although we were at that time but a very
small boy, well do we remember all that passed under our
observation at that stirring period. We remember the letters that
were received from the volunteers describing their sufferings from
cold and hunger and nakedness, and we remember, too, how the ladies
united together for the purpose of sending clothing to the
suffering soldiery. They formed themselves into sewing societies,
made hunting shirts, knit socks, purchased blankets and fitted up
all kinds of garments that could add to the comfort of the troops.
The ladies of the town of Frankfort, alone, sent two wagon loads of
clothing to the frontier, which arrived most timely, and warmed
alike the hearts and bodies of the volunteers, for they reminded
them that such wives and mothers and sisters deserved to be
defended at every possible hazard.</p>
<p>A Spartan mother is said, on presenting a shield to her son, to
have told him "to return, <i>with it or upon it</i>." It is recorded of
another, that when her son complained of the shortness of his
sword, she bade him "take one step nearer his enemy and he would
find it long enough." And for such sayings as these, the Spartan
women have ever since been renowned in history. We remember an
incident that occurred in our own presence during the last war,
that proves that a Kentucky mother was fully equal in courage and
love of country to any of those whose fame has survived for so many
ages. We beg leave to relate it, and will do so in as few words as
possible.</p>
<p>Soon after the battle of the river Raisin, where the Captain of
the Frankfort company (Pascal Hickman,) had been barbarously
massacred in the officers' house after the surrender, Lieutenant
Peter Dudley returned to Frankfort for the purpose of raising
another company. The preceding and recent events of the campaigns
had demonstrated to all that war was, in reality, a trade of blood,
and the badges of mourning, worn by male and female, evidenced that
<i>here</i> its most dire calamity had been felt. He who would
<i>volunteer</i> now, knew that he embarked in a hazardous enterprise.
On the occasion alluded to, there was a public gathering of the
people. The young Lieutenant, with a drummer and fifer, commenced
his march through the crowd, proclaiming his purpose of raising
another company, and requesting all who were willing to go with
him, to fall in the ranks. In a few moments he was at the head of a
respectable number of young men; and, as he marched around, others
were continually dropping in. There was, in the crowd of
spectators, a lad of fifteen years of age; a pale stripling of a
boy, the son of a widow, whose dwelling was hard by the parade
ground. He had looked on with a burning heart, and filled with the
passion of patriotism, until he could refrain no longer, and, as
the volunteers passed again, he leaped into the ranks with the
resolve to be a soldier. "You are a brave boy," exclaimed the
Captain, "and I will take care of you;" and a feeling of admiration
ran through the crowd.</p>
<p>In a little time, the news was borne to the widow, that her son
was marching with the volunteers. It struck a chill into her heart,
for he was her oldest son. In a few moments she came in breathless
haste, and with streaming eyes, to the father of the editor of this
paper, who was her nearest neighbor, and long tried friend. "Mr.
Brown," said she, "James has joined the volunteers! the foolish boy
does not know what he is about. I want you to make haste and get
him out of the ranks. He is too young&mdash;he is weak and sickly. Mr.
Brown, he will die on the march. If he does not die on the march he
will be killed by the enemy, for he is too small to take care of
himself. If he escapes the enemy he will die of the fever. Oh, my
friend, go and take him away." After a few moments, she commenced
again&mdash;"I do not know what has got into the boy&mdash;I cannot conceive
why he wants to go to the army&mdash;he could do nothing, he is able to
do nothing." Again she paused; and at last rising from her seat,
with her eyes flashing fire, she exclaimed&mdash;"BUT I WOULD DESPISE
HIM, IF HE DID NOT WANT TO GO!" That noble thought changed the
current of her reflections, and of her grief&mdash;she went home,
prepared with her own hands the plain uniform of that day for her
son, and sent him forth with a mother's blessing. The lad went on
with the troops, bore all the toils of the march, was in the battle
at Fort Meigs, and fought as bravely and efficiently as the boldest
man in the company. The widow's son again came home in safety. Her
patriotism has not been unrewarded. On yesterday I saw that son
bending over the sick bed of the aged mother. He is the only
surviving child of a numerous family, and has been spared as the
stay and prop of her declining years.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that the Kentuckians are brave and chivalric?
Were they otherwise, they would be recreant to the land of their
birth, and a reproach to their mothers' milk."</p>
<br>
<p><i>Erratum</i>.&mdash;For <i>Captain Watson</i>, read <i>Captain Matson</i>,
wherever it occurs.</p>
<br>
<p><a name=footnote>*</a><b>Footnote</b> [<a href="#footnotecall">return</a>] Having marked the place where this old
Frenchman lived, in order that I might the more readily find him,
should I ever be permitted to visit the country again: and having
taken particular notice of the house, I found no difficulty in
ascertaining its location, and even the very habitation in which
the old tory resided.</p>
<p>After the lapse of about eighteen months, from the time I was
there a prisoner with the Indians, I was there again under <i>General
McArthur</i>, who commanded a regiment of mounted volunteers&mdash;one
battalion of which was from Kentucky, under the command of Major
<i>Peter Dudley</i>.</p>
<p>Passing by this old man's house, in company with Benjamin
Whitaker, our Lieutenant, we met this man in the street near his
own house; I immediately recognized him as the individual who had
so inhumanly assisted in the massacre of young Mr. Blythe, at Stony
creek.</p>
<p>I mentioned the circumstance to Whitaker, and asked his advice
in reference to the course best to be pursued; who instantly
replied, "<i>let us take him</i>." I was glad of the opportunity, and
forthwith approached him, and the first salutation, as near as I
can recollect, was, "<i>Well sir, do you know any thing of me?</i>" His
reply was, "No sir, I know nothing about you." "Well sir," said I,
"I know you very well." He seemed at first to be somewhat surprised
at my confident address, and looking on me very earnestly seemed to
express some doubts on the subject. I, however, soon removed the
old man's doubts, by remarking to him, "You are the man who was
guilty of the cruel and inhuman act of assisting the savages in
killing one of the prisoners at Stony creek, taken at Raisin,
January 23, 1813. You are the very man, sir, and I saw you do it."
These words come upon him, no doubt, very unexpectedly; and being
seconded by the voice of conscience within, made him tremble. He
discovered evident marks of fear, his countenance grew pale in an
instant; and finding that his very fear had betrayed him, he did
not deny it; but offered as an excuse that the Indians required it
of him, and that he was afraid to refuse. This excuse, however, did
not satisfy us. We considered, that as a citizen of Detroit, he had
no business with the British army in time of battle. We, therefore,
took him, without any further ceremony about it, and delivered him
over to the proper authorities. He was confined in jail for eight
or ten days, and then brought out for trial. I, of course, was the
only evidence that appeared against him. He plead the same excuse
he did when we first arrested him.</p>
<p>After nearly a whole day's managing in the matter, between the
lawyers and the jury, and after alarming the old fellow nearly to
death, they acquitted him.</p>
<p>I soon found that this circumstance had enraged the French
population against me&mdash;particularly the old Catholic French. I,
therefore, found it necessary, when going alone up town, to take my
gun with me well loaded: this I considered a sufficient protection
against any attack from that quarter.</p>
